Recent publications indicate that the majority of gliomas display upregulated Raf/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, which is an essential serine/threonine kinase constituent of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.

If this idea is correct, then it may be the case that the Ras-Raf-MEK-MAPK module serves in muscle as a central integrator of signals from other tissues, much as the polarization of the plasma membrane appears to do for proteasome based degradation.
LET-60/Ras can act independently of Raf-MEK-ERK to stimulate an alternative pathway involving RGL-1 (related to mammalian Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator or RalGDS) and the RAL-1 GTPase (
Raf, MEK and ERK activities depend in large part on their phosphorylation status (
There is evidence that some genes may influence Raf-MEK-ERK signaling indirectly, by affecting neighboring cells.

('PI3K', 'FAK', 'adds_modification')
CCR9-CCL25 axis provides survival advantage to BrCa cells and inhibits cisplatin-induced apoptosis in a PI3K-dependent and focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-independent fashion.
This study investigates the role of CCR9-CCL25 interactions and requirement for PI3K and FAK activation in BrCa cell survival and cisplatin resistance.
We also show that CCR9-CCL25 interaction promotes cell proliferation and upregulated anti-apoptotic signaling, which is mediated by the PI3K/Akt survival pathway, independent of FAK.

('AR', 'FOXA1', 'increases')
In LNCaP cells over half of the AR binding loci are also bound by FOXA1.
On most of these sites, FOXA1 binds before hormone treatment and AR recruitment.
Interestingly, FOXA1 ablation causes massive reprogramming of the AR cistrome: 40% of loci are preserved with increased level of AR recruitment, the remaining 60% of loci are lost, and many new AR binding sites appear, causing the AR cistrome to increase more than fourfold with corresponding changes in gene expression [
