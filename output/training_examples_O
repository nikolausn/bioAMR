Before we discuss the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR signaling cascades, it is important to define some genetic terms as they are critical to understanding the importance of these pathways and the classes of genes and mutations that occur in components of these cascades.
This event can result in the activation of many downstream signaling cascades including the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways.
Regulation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways is mediated by a series of kinases, phosphatases, GTP:GDP exchange and scaffolding proteins.

Some scientists and clinicians have considered that the simultaneous targeting of Raf and MEK by individual or dual inhibitors may be more effective in cancer therapy than just targeting Raf or MEK by themselves.
This is based in part on the fact that there are intricate feed-back loops from ERK which can inhibit Raf and MEK.
This is a rationale for treatment with both MEK and Raf inhibitors or dual inhibitors.
Finally, an emerging concept is the targeting of two different signal transduction pathways, Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR for example.
Sometimes dysregulated expression of growth factor receptors occurs by increased expression, genetic translocations or genomic amplifications which can lead to activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR and other signaling pathways.

NF1 normally serves to regulate Ras and thus is implicated in the regulation of both the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 and Raf/MEK/ERK pathways.
Targeting signaling molecules involved with the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 and Raf/MEK/ERK pathways may be appropriate to overcome resistance to chemo- and hormonal therapy.
The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is also important in breast cancer drug resistance [
The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway also interacts with key proteins involved in protein translation (indicated in green ovals).

The possibility of treating certain patients with a Raf and a MEK inhibitors is a concept which is gaining more acceptance as it may be a therapeutic possibility to overcome resistance [
There are at least two ERK molecules regulated by the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade, ERK1 and ERK2.
Previously, we have predominantly discussed studies that employed a single Raf or MEK inhibitor, sometimes in combination with a chemotherapeutic drug.
Combinations of Raf and PI3K/mTOR or MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors are in clinical trials.
Chemotherapeutic drugs can activate the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway by diverse mechanisms.
Drugs such as doxorubicin can activate p53 which can lead to increased expression of the discoidin domain receptor (DDR), which in turn can result in Raf/MEK/ERK pathway activation.
As mentioned previously, a side effect of some chemotherapeutic drugs, such as paclitaxel, is the induction of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway.

However, MEK inhibitors may have limited effectiveness in treating human cancers, unless the particular cancer proliferates directly in response to the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway.
Some scientists and clinicians have considered that the simultaneous targeting of Raf and MEK by individual inhibitors may be more effective in cancer therapy than just targeting Raf or MEK by themselves.
This is based in part on the fact that there are intricate feed-back loops from ERK which can inhibit Raf and MEK.
This is a rationale for treatment with either dual Raf/MEK inhibitors or simultaneously with both Raf and MEK individual inhibitors.
Finally, an emerging concept is the dual targeting of two different signal transduction pathways, Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR for example.
For example, cancer researchers predominantly feel that Raf, MEK, PI3K, Akt and mTOR inhibitors will suppress the growth of malignant cancer cells.

For example, acquired drug resistance to sorafenib (targeting angiogenesis and Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathways) have been attributed to the activation of PI3K/AKT and EGFR [
Although RKIP was best studied for its inhibition of Raf-initiated activation of MEK [
Two pathways that are often upregulated in chemo- and hormonal-resistance are the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways.
These results indicate that up regulation of the Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway in the presence of elevated Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling together can contribute to drug-resistance by diminishing cell senescence in response to chemotherapy.
In addition to deregulation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway, the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway plays a critical role in cellular transformation and drug resistance.
In the following study, we examined the effects of activated PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways on the induction of cellular senescence in response to chemo-/hormonal therapy.
Our results suggest that deregulation of PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR, and to a lesser extent the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, decreases drug-induced cellular senescence in response to chemo-/hormonal therapy.
Since we observed elevated activated ERK1/2 expression in MCF7/DoxR cells, the activity of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade was manipulated in MCF-7 cells in order to determine whether signals transduced by this pathway control the induction of drug-induced senescence.
Together, these results suggest that presence activated PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway in the presence of acquired drug resistant Raf/MEK/ERK pathway activation is sufficient to block drug-induced senescence to both doxorubicin and 4HT.
Doxorubicin induces the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in MCF-7 cells and higher levels of active ERK are detected in MCF7/DoxR cells than in drug sensitive MCF-7 cells.
Taken together with the results observed with MCF7/DoxR cells, which express high levels of activated ERK, it is likely that increased levels of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway does not inhibit the induction of cellular senescence induced by either 4HT or doxorubicin.
In some cases, the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway may induce cellular senescence [
SkE also abrogated MEK1/2 and B-Raf phosphorylation but had no effect on Ras activity.

Of note, SkE was highly efficient in cells exhibiting constitutive activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway.
We next sought to identify the specific point in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway affected by SkE in different cellular models with either constitutive or inducible MAPK kinase activation.
Importantly, SkE impaired the activities of both MEK and B-Raf.
Consistent with our data, recent studies have shown that TRAIL-resistant cells were sensitized by combinatorial treatment of TRAIL with cetuximab (an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody) or sorafenib (a multi-kinase inhibitor that acts on Raf kinases, MEK, and ERK signaling) in different cancer cell lines and tumor xenograft models [
MEK1 and MEK2 are kinases that link the cascade between Raf and ERK, and their inactive unphosphorylated forms (u-MEK1/2) become phosphorylated (p-MEK1/2) and hence activated by Raf kinase.

The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway may regulate downstream transcription factors such as GATA-1 which control the transcription of genes such as XRCC1 and ERCC1 which are involved in DNA repair and their aberrant expression may contribute to drug resistance.
As mentioned previously, a side effect of some chemotherapeutic drugs, such as paclitaxel, is the induction of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathways.

While we have discussed the roles of these pathways in cancer in significant detail, an additional important aspect of targeting the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways is to halt cellular aging, which in the end, kills all those who either do not have or have been fortunate to survive cancer and other diseases.
Various pharmaceutical companies have developed inhibitors to the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway.
However, these inhibitors may have limited effectiveness in treating human cancers, unless the particular cancer proliferates directly in response to the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway.
Mutations at many of the upstream receptor genes or Ras can result in abnormal Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway activation.
If the tumor exhibits a dependency on the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, then it may be sensitive to Raf and MEK inhibitors.
In contrast, tumors that do not display enhanced expression of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway may not be sensitive to either Raf or MEK inhibitors but if the Ras/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is activated, it may be sensitive to specific inhibitors that target this pathway.
Some scientists and clinicians have considered that the simultaneous targeting of Raf and MEK by individual inhibitors may be more effective in cancer therapy than just targeting Raf or MEK by themselves.
This is based in part on the fact that there are intricate feed-back loops from ERK which can inhibit Raf and MEK.
This is a rationale for treatment with both MEK and Raf inhibitors.
Finally, an emerging concept is the dual targeting of two different signal transduction pathways, Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR for example.

('AR', 'FOXA1', 'increases')
FOXA1 is a key component of the AR transcriptional complex yet its role in prostate cancer progression and the relationship between AR and FOXA1 are not completely resolved.
We mimicked these conditions by over-expressing FOXA1 in the androgen-responsive LNCaP prostate cancer cell line and observed a significant increase in AR genomic binding at novel regions that possess increased chromatin accessibility.
Together these results suggest that in an androgen-depleted state, elevated levels of FOXA1 enhance AR binding at genomic regions not normally occupied by AR, which in turn facilitates prostate cancer cell growth.
The forkhead transcription factor FOXA1 is a key member of the AR transcriptional complex, which has been shown to interact directly with AR through the hinge domain (
Examination of AR binding events in CRPC cell line models and primary tissues suggests that the unique CRPC AR sites are not reliant upon FOXA1 (
In this study, we assessed the downstream effects of elevated FOXA1 levels on AR chromatin binding, gene expression and prostate cancer cell proliferation.
We found that in cells expressing higher levels of FOXA1, AR makes novel chromatin associations and is able to drive tumor cell growth even at reduced levels of androgen, suggesting that tumors with higher FOXA1 levels may have a growth advantage following androgen deprivation.
In order to infer the mechanism behind the increased AR binding seen after FOXA1 over-expression, we assessed whether there was a global increase in AR protein levels, but we did not detect an appreciable change in AR levels following FOXA1 over-expression (
In an effort to identify additional regulatory mechanisms that impinge on the AR-FOXA1 complex, we performed RIME (Rapid IMmunoprecipitation of Endogenous proteins) proteomic analysis (
The effect of high levels of FOXA1 on prostate cancer proliferation was assessed in AR+ LNCaP prostate cancer cells and our second AR-driven cancer model, the MDA-MB-453 molecular apocrine breast cancer cell line.

FOXA1 is a well-established member of the AR transcription complex, where it is required to direct AR binding to tissue specific sites by opening up chromatin (
In summary, FOXA1 is a key component of the AR transcription factor complex.
High levels of FOXA1 result in increased AR binding, a transcription profile akin to CRPC and proliferation in the presence of low levels of androgenic hormones.

('MEK', 'ERK', 'adds_modification')
Classic downstream pathways of the EGFR signal pathway are Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK/MAPK and PI3K/PDK1/Akt (protein kinase B [PKB]),
First, sorafenib suppresses the proliferation of tumor cells by inhibiting the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signal pathway.
More recently, many reports demonstrated that several signaling pathways crosstalk with the canonical Hh pathway, including transforming growth factor, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), PI3K/Akt, and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells pathways.
Both EGFR-RAS-MEK-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signal transduction and C-MET-PI3K-AKT signal transduction have roles in the prevention of apoptosis, the regulation of cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation.
The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway has been demonstrated to be constitutively activated in a wide variety of tumors including BTC.
Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor that targets the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway or the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway.
Activation of the VEGF receptor leads to signaling via the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway.
Key mutations that lead to constitutive activation of tumor growth and survival pathways occur in the receptor tyrosine kinase CKIT (CD117), and the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and phosphoinositide- 3-OH kinase (PI3K)/Protein Kinase B (AKT)/ phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) signal transduction systems (
The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway plays a role in normal organogenesis; however, when aberrantly activated it can lead to malignant cellular proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, and invasion.
Sorafenib acts by inhibiting the activity of c-Raf and B-Raf; vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR); the mitogen-activated protein kinases MEK and ERK; and platelet derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR).
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, consisting of the kinase cascade RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK, is the most commonly activated signaling pathway in melanoma.
As this aberrant activity of the MAPK pathway drives tumor cell proliferation and survival, many targeted therapies have been developed to inhibit key proteins in this kinase cascade, such as BRAF, MEK or ERK. 
The MEKi-induced skin toxicity has been suggested to be mediated by inhibition of ERK activity, which is known to be crucial for the maturation of keratinocytes.
It has been postulated that MEKi treatment leads to skin toxicities by inducing downregulation of pERK levels in keratinocytes, whereas the BRAFi-mediated skin toxicity is believed to result from paradoxical upregulation of pERK levels in these cells.
The relative quantification of pERK1/2 levels in the skin of treated mice showed that although MEKi-associated skin toxicity was reduced, the decreased pERK1/2 levels upon MEKi treatment were not restored when synchronous BRAFi treatment was used.
Thus, whereas reduced levels of pERK1/2 in skin may still contribute to the MEKi-induced skin toxicity, our data indicate that restoring these levels of pERK1/2 to baseline levels is not required to alleviate MEKi-associated skin toxicity.
Skin pERK levels do not correlate with reduced MEKi-induced skin toxicity upon synchronous BRAFi.
Mechanistic studies revealed that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/MAPK signaling pathways were activated through elevated expression of phosphorylated (p)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p-AKT, mTOR, p-mTOR, p-P70S6K, and reduced expression of p-P38 and LC3-II (the marker of autophagy) in 231/Gem in comparison to control cells.

Further mechanistic studies confirmed that PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MEK/MAPK signaling pathways were activated through elevated expression of p-ERK, p-AKT, mTOR, p-mTOR, and p-P70S6K, and reduced expression of p-P38 and LC3-II (the marker of autophagy) in 231/Gem as compared to control cells.
Paclitaxel induces activation of the MEK/ERK pathway in human breast cancer
Phosphorylation of ERK1/2, downstream molecules of MEK, was effectively inhibited with selumetinib in melanoma, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, and hepatocellular cancer cell lines harboring 
Because inhibition of ERK phosphorylation has been used as a pharmacodynamic biomarker of MEK inhibitor activity,
Activated RAF kinases phosphorylate and activate MEK1/2, which in turn phosphorylate and activate ERK1/2, leading to cellular proliferation, survival, and differentiation, and to an inhibitory feedback toward upstream components of the pathway.
The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade plays a critical role in the transmission of signals to regulate gene expression and cell proliferation [
Several studies indicate that melanoma cells are addicted to constitutive activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK cascade.

This is based in part on the fact that there are intricate feed-back loops from ERK which can inhibit Raf and MEK.
For example when MEK1 is targeted, ERK1,2 is inhibited and the negative feed-back loop on MEK is broken and activated MEK accumulates.
Finally, an emerging concept is the targeting of two different signal transduction pathways, Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR for example.
Sometimes dysregulated expression of growth factor receptors occurs by increased expression, genetic translocations or genomic amplifications which can lead to activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR and other signaling pathways.

Two pathways that are often upregulated in chemo- and hormonal-resistance are the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways.
These results indicate that up regulation of the Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway in the presence of elevated Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling together can contribute to drug-resistance by diminishing cell senescence in response to chemotherapy.
In addition to deregulation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway, the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway plays a critical role in cellular transformation and drug resistance.
In the following study, we examined the effects of activated PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways on the induction of cellular senescence in response to chemo-/hormonal therapy.
Our results suggest that deregulation of PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR, and to a lesser extent the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, decreases drug-induced cellular senescence in response to chemo-/hormonal therapy.
Since we observed elevated activated ERK1/2 expression in MCF7/DoxR cells, the activity of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade was manipulated in MCF-7 cells in order to determine whether signals transduced by this pathway control the induction of drug-induced senescence.
Together, these results suggest that presence activated PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway in the presence of acquired drug resistant Raf/MEK/ERK pathway activation is sufficient to block drug-induced senescence to both doxorubicin and 4HT.
Doxorubicin induces the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in MCF-7 cells and higher levels of active ERK are detected in MCF7/DoxR cells than in drug sensitive MCF-7 cells.
Taken together with the results observed with MCF7/DoxR cells, which express high levels of activated ERK, it is likely that increased levels of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway does not inhibit the induction of cellular senescence induced by either 4HT or doxorubicin.

Also the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway can modulate the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and altering MEK activity can have opposing effects on different cell types [
The cytotoxic effects of combinations of MEK inhibitors and paclitaxel may be specific for cells of certain origins and may depend on the levels of endogenous activated MEK/ERK present in those cells.
In a study with NSCLC cells which constitutively-expressed activated MEK/ERK, no increase in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis was observed when the cells were treated with a MEK inhibitor [
A side effect of radiotherapy in some cells is induction of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade [
An overview of the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways in some of novel aspects of their usage is presented in Figure 
The Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways also play critical roles in the regulation of cellular senescence and quiescence [
While we have discussed the roles of these pathways in cancer in significant detail, an additional important aspect of targeting the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways is to halt cellular aging, which in the end, kills all those who either do not have or have been fortunate to survive cancer and other diseases.
Various pharmaceutical companies have developed inhibitors to the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway.
However, these inhibitors may have limited effectiveness in treating human cancers, unless the particular cancer proliferates directly in response to the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway.
Mutations at many of the upstream receptor genes or Ras can result in abnormal Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway activation.
If the tumor exhibits a dependency on the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, then it may be sensitive to Raf and MEK inhibitors.
In contrast, tumors that do not display enhanced expression of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway may not be sensitive to either Raf or MEK inhibitors but if the Ras/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is activated, it may be sensitive to specific inhibitors that target this pathway.
This is based in part on the fact that there are intricate feed-back loops from ERK which can inhibit Raf and MEK.
For example when MEK1 is targeted, ERK1,2 is inhibited and the negative feed-back loop on MEK is broken and activated MEK accumulates.
Finally, an emerging concept is the dual targeting of two different signal transduction pathways, Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR for example.
Recently it has been observed that the suppression of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways may prevent the induction of cellular senescence and aging.
Recent findings suggest that eIF4E activity is a key determinant of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK mediated tumorigenic activity and targeting eIF4E should have a major impact on these pathways in human cancer.
Such inhibitor compounds will serve as chemical biology tools for pharmacological target validation in terms of Mnk's role in regulation of Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR and Jak/STAT pathways in cancers, as well as their functions required for normal physiological process.
However, both mTORC1 and eIF4B are targeted also by the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway.

IL-7 activates MEK/ERK in T-ALL primary cells, however pharmacological inhibition of MEK/ERK did not have any negative effects on cell cycle progression and survival [
For example, crosstalk between the PI3K and MAPK pathways enables mTOR inhibition to enhance ERK phosphorylation and MEK inhibition to activate AKT [
Increased ROS can stimulate Ras activity and phosphorylate MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, which are ROS level dependent tumor-associated pathways.

Using the selective MEK inhibitor PD325901, we demonstrated that blocking this increase in ERK signaling is sufficient to cause synergy in combination with p70S6 kinase inhibition.
To better understand the cytoprotective action of ERK in the context of Baf1A-induced cell death, we exposed MDA-MB-231 cells to hypoxia in the presence and absence of Baf1A and quantified c-raf-MEK1/2- ERK1/2 signaling.
Many studies have shown that drugs targeting the S1P pathway can modulate crucial pro-survival signaling cascades such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK [
We demonstrated that the elevated invasiveness was a result of the activated EGFR-MEK/ERK signaling, which in turn leads to ZEB1 dependent MMP2 induction.
These results suggest that the EGFR-MEK/ERK/ZEB1/MMP2 axis is responsible for promoted invasion in EMT-induced NSCLCs.
Thereby, these data suggest that the EGFR-MEK/ERK signaling would be a promising molecular target to control aberrant MMP2 expression and consequent invasion in the EMT-induced NSCLCs
In this study, we found that the EGFR-MEK/ERK signaling is aberrantly activated by simple depletion of E-cadherin, and is also closely associated to invasion in MMP2 dependent manner.
A closer examination revealed that the ZEB1, of which expression is regulated by EGFR-MEK/ERK signaling, is responsible for the invasive property through upregulation of MMP2.
Consistently, the positive correlation between loss of E-cadherin and ERK activation was also observed in the disseminating cancer cells of NSCLC patients, demonstrating that the EGFR-MEK/ERK axis would be a promising target for attenuating deviant MMP2 expression and the subsequent invasive trait in EMT-induced NSCLCs.
The EGFR-dependent gene expression could primarily be mediated by the MEK/ERK or the PI3K/Akt signaling, or cooperatively by the two pathways.
On the basis of MEK/ERK signaling-dependent 
Our data suggest that EGFR-dependent signaling would be an important therapeutic target for NSCLC treatment, based on the results such as the requirement of MEK/ERK signaling in the invasive properties of EMT-induced A549 cells (Fig. 
In summary, we show that loss of E-cadherin results in activation of MEK/ERK signaling, showing the positive correlation between loss of E-cadherin and ERK activation.
MEK inhibitor, CI-1040, was used to inhibit the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MEK) and the downstream MAPK/ERK activities to decrease phosphorylation of Mcl-1 and hence its stability.
A key Ras effector pathway is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Raf-MEK-ERK pathway.
Active Raf dimer phosphorylates and activates mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 and 2 (MEK1/2), which induces ERK1/2 activation.
Inhibition of the BRAF/MEK/ERK signaling cascade may increase TRIM16, as TRIM16 may be a negatively regulated downstream target.
In contrast to the reactivation of the MEK and mTOR signaling seen in single drug treatments, when mice were treated with Everolimus and PD-901 in combination, p-AKT, p-4EBP, and p-ERK were all inhibited at early timepoints, and remained low at later time points (Figure

EGFR dimerization results in autophosphorylation, kinase activation, and subsequent activation of three major signaling pathways,including RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK1/2, PI3K/AKT and STATs pathways.
To investigate the mechanisms underlying the melanoma cell resistance to BRAF-I, the expression and activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathway components were analyzed in the cell lines both under basal conditions and after treatment with vemurafenib.
Therefore both PKC and MEK/ERK pathways are involved in AXL overexpression in TKI-resistant CML cell lines.
To validate the microarray data, we performed Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses and focused on a subset of genes that are either down-regulated (ErbB2, AKT, MEK1, ERK1/2, Bcl-2) or up-regulated (p21, Bax).
However, we have found that the expression of the other BH3-only protein Noxa is commonly upregulated in melanoma cells, and that this is driven by oncogenic activation of MEK/ERK.
A characteristic of human melanoma is constitutive activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway [
We report here that the increase in Noxa expression is driven by oncogenic activation of MEK/ERK signaling through the transcription factor cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB), and that Noxa contributes to constitutive activation of autophagy in melanoma cells.
To further consolidate that activation of the MEK/ERK pathway upregulates Noxa in melanocytic cells, we infected HEMn-MP human melanocytes with lentiviral constructs expressing BRAF
The role of CREB in regulation of Noxa by MEK/ERK signaling was further confirmed by its association with the 
To test whether constitutive activation of MEK/ERK signaling is essential for the autophagy activity in melanoma cells, we treated IgR3 and Mel-RM cells with U0126 before the addition of bafilomycin A1.
Noxa plays a role in induction of autophagy by oncogenic activation of RAS, which is an upstream kinase of RAF/MEK/ERK signaling [
In this report, we present evidence that the BH3-only protein Noxa is upregulated by oncogenic activation of MEK/ERK signaling, and that Noxa plays an important role in regulation of autophagy in melanoma cells.
While the increase in Noxa expression was associated with melanoma development and progression, inhibition of MEK/ERK signaling downregulated, and activation of the pathway upregulated, the expression of Noxa in melanoma cells.
The finding that oncogenic activation of MEK/ERK signaling is responsible for Noxa upregulation in melanoma cells is similarly intriguing, as oncogenic activation of the MEK/ERK pathway is known to be a major driver of the pathogenesis of melanoma that suppresses apoptosis [
In summary, we have demonstrated that oncogenic activation of MEK/ERK signaling upregulates the expression of Noxa, which plays an important role in activation of autophagy, in particular, in melanoma cells under nutrient starvation conditions.
These results not only reveal an unexpected role of Noxa in protection of melanoma cells from apoptosis through activation of autophagy in a context-dependent manner, but also uncover a novel mechanism by which oncogenic activation of MEK/ERK promotes the pathogenesis of melanoma.
MEK1/2 is immediately upstream of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, and has been reported to activate ERK1/2 [
Current efforts concentrate on developing inhibitors of RAS and its key downstream effectors, BRAF, MEK, ERK [
Apart from the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK/MNK pathway, effective inhibitors specific for many of the key components of the Ras/PI3K/PTEN/mTOR have also been developed since both of these pathways are often implicated in therapeutic resistance and interact with other pathways [
First, KRAS can activate also other substrates and not only PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, like BRAF/MEK/ERK pathway, Rho and Ral pathways.
The p21-activated protein kinase 1 (PAK1) also interacts with the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR cascades.
KRAS and BRAF mutations lead to the constitutive activation of EGFR signalling through the oncogenic RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway.
Mutational status was correlated with growth inhibition and apoptosis induction by the MEK inhibitor CI-1040 that prevented activation of the downstream target, ERK1/2.
Recent studies have revealed an additional MEK/ERK pathway that is required for the acquisition of at least one hallmark of senescence: hyper-accumulation of cyclin D1 [
Compensatory activation of parallel signaling through the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway in response to PI3K/ Akt inhibition, is an emerging theme in cancer cell signal transduction.
Indeed, several recent reports have highlighted the importance of functional cross talks between the MEK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling networks, in response to individual pathway inhibitors [
However, MK-2206 increased the phosphorylation levels of ERK 1/2, through a MEK-dependent mechanism, as the hyperphosphorylation was blocked by the MEK inhibitor, AZD6244.

Depending on the cellular context, PMA can cause either cell cycle progression or cell cycle arrest by inducing both cyclin D1 and p21 via the MEK/ERK pathway [
Since PMA activates the MEK/ERK pathway, we investigated whether inhibition of MEK can prevent PMA-induced phosphorylation of S6K and S6.
In SKBR3 cells, strong activation of MEK/ERK pathway by PMA causes induction of p21 and cell cycle arrest.
The RAF-MEK-ERK pathway regulates many important cellular processes (reviewed in [
Consistent with its role as a key regulatory pathway for cell survival and proliferation, RAF-MEK-ERK signaling is frequently dysregulated in cancer.
RAF-MEK-ERK signaling can be driven by aberrant activation of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) or by oncogenic mutations of intracellular components of this pathway.
Preclinical data has demonstrated that most BRAF mutant human tumor-derived cell lines are exquisitely sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition of RAF-MEK-ERK signaling.
A schematic of the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway is shown with BRAF in red.
The vast majority of acquired resistance mechanisms to BRAF or MEK inhibitors that have been identified to date lead to reactivation of ERK signaling despite the presence of inhibitor.
Careful evaluation of the dose-response relationship between BRAF inhibitor treatment and phosophorylation of MEK and ERK revealed that, in resistant cells, levels of P-MEK could be reduced by ~50% before any noticeable decrease in P-ERK levels was observed.
This was in stark contrast to parental cells, in which a ~50% decrease in P-MEK levels led to a ~50% decrease in P-ERK levels.
These findings suggested that the high levels of P-MEK in resistant cells (driven by BRAF amplification) were in excess of levels required for near-maximal ERK phosphorylation.
As a result, a much higher concentration of BRAF or MEK inhibitor was required to fully suppress ERK phosphorylation in resistant cells, either by reducing excess P-MEK levels (as in the case of the BRAF inhibitor) or by inhibiting excess MEK activity (as in the case of the MEK inhibitor).
However, if resistant cells were treated with a low dose of BRAF inhibitor sufficient to reduce levels of P-MEK to amounts observed under basal conditions in parental cells, the ability of MEK inhibitors to suppress P-ERK was completely restored.
As discussed above, the majority of the resistance mechanisms to BRAF and MEK inhibition that have been identified lead to ERK reactivation and retain dependence on ERK signaling.
Because RTKs can signal through multiple RAF isoforms by activation of RAS proteins, and since RTKs activate multiple signaling pathways in addition to RAF-MEK-ERK, the authors investigated whether resistant cells showed differences in RTK phosphorylation relative to parental cells.
However, pharmacologic inhibition of IGF1R decreased proliferation of resistant cells, and combined inhibition of IGF1R and MEK induced dramatic apoptosis, suggesting that ERK-independent survival signaling was mediated by IGF1R in resistant cells.
In addition to activating the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, IGF1R and other RTKs are known to activate PI3K-AKT signaling, which is known to be an important regulator of cell survival and proliferation [
As a result, an alternative approach might be to assess resistant tumor specimens for common indicators of ERK-dependent or ERK-independent resistance, perhaps by assessing biomarkers of RAF-MEK-ERK or PI3K-AKT signaling in a biopsy taken while the patient remains on treatment.

Because of its key role in the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, BRAF has been the subject of intense investigation, leading to the approval by regulatory agencies of 2 distinct BRAF inhibitors (BRAFis), vemurafenib and dabrafenib, for use in melanoma patients.
One of these strategies involved the concurrent administration of BRAF and MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors, de facto targeting two distinct nodes of the same signaling pathway.
One of such strategies relies on the use of mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors targeting the BRAF/MEK/ERK pathway, which is constitutively activated in a majority of melanomas.

Recent Phase 1 results with PLX4032/RG7204/Vemurafenib, which selectively inhibits B-RAF/MEK/ERK1/2 signaling in mutant B-RAF cells, has given encouragement to this struggling field.
MEKK2 regulates ERK5 activation in response to growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (
Because MEKK2 is required for EGF receptor activation of ERK5, we next assessed whether knockdown of ERK5 in MDA-MB-231 cells would show similar tumor growth and metastasis phenotypes as with MEKK2 knockdown.
MEKK2 mediates activation of ERK5 by EGFR and Her2 and is required for tumor growth and metastasis.
(a) MEKK2 knockdown inhibits ERK5 activation in response to EGF.
(c) Lysates from control and MEKK2 shRNA expressing BT474 cells were blotted for ERK5, MEKK2, phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-JNK or tubulin as a loading control.

MAPK activity was reduced through the use of pharmacological inhibitors, including MEK inhibitors (U0126 and PD98059) to block ERK activation and a JNK inhibitor (SP600125) to block JNK activity.
Incubation with either MEK inhibitor caused significant reduction in ERK phosphorylation relative to treatment with the negative control (U0124) or DMSO (
Growth factor-induced MUC1-C translation was found to be mediated by PI3K->AKT, and not MEK->ERK1/2, signaling.
The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway is deregulated in over 90% of malignant melanomas and targeting MEK as central kinase of this pathway is currently tested in clinical trials.
However, dose-limiting side effects are observed, and MEK inhibitors that sufficiently reduce ERK activation in patients show a low clinical response.
Moreover, the combination of saracatinib and selumetinib effectively suppressed the growth and invasion of melanoma cells in a 3D environment, suggesting that combined inhibition of MEK and SRC is a promising approach to improve the efficacy of targeting the ERK/MAP kinase pathway in melanoma.
The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway is deregulated in over 90% of malignant melanomas.
A potent orally active MEK inhibitor that blocks ERK activation in cells at a concentration of 10-100nM is selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) (
In melanoma cells expressing the oncogenic mutated BRAF MEK is constitutively active, but treatment with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib suppresses this activity and this can be detected in a loss of phosphorylation of ERK (
We demonstrate that knock down of mutant B-RAF or inhibition of MEK/ERK signaling results in an increase in Rac1 activity due to the activation of the Rac1 GEF Tiam1.
In melanoma cells expressing BRAFV600E the activity of MEK and ERK is high, leading to low Tiam1 activity followed by low Rac activity.
At 32h GRD expression significantly reduces Ras-GTP and downstream P-MEK and P-ERK (
MEK inhibitors induce epidermal growth factor-induced AKT activation, ERK phosphorylates TSC2 and RAPTOR to promote TORC1 activity, and AKT can phosphorylate Raf at inhibitory sites that negatively regulate MEK activity (
Characterization of the negative effect of ATF2 on transformation by v-Rel revealed a novel role for ATF2 in the regulation of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway.
Although ATF2 inhibited v-Rel-induced activation of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway, the overexpression of ATF2 alone in DT40 cells resulted in the slight activation of Ha-Ras (
In fibroblasts, the overexpression of ATF2 (in the absence or presence of v-Rel) blocked the activation of c-Raf, MEK1/2, and ERK.
However, in the DT40 B-cell line, overexpression of ATF2 in the absence of v-Rel increased Ha-Ras activity and phosphorylated c-Raf (Ser338) levels whereas phospho-MEK1/2 and phospho-ERK levels were found to be decreased.
Our results suggest that negative regulation of c-Raf activity is responsible for the reduced levels of phosphorylated MEK1/2 and ERK.
Our results indicate that ATF2 can regulate the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway at multiple steps.

The MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways are often concurrently activated by separate genetic alterations in colorectal cancer (CRC), which is associated with CRC progression and poor survival.
In CRC cells with coexistent mutational activation of ERK and AKT pathways, inhibition of either MEK or AKT alone showed limited activity in inhibiting cell migration and invasion, but combined inhibition resulted in profound effects.
The MAPK intracellular signaling cascade comprises RAS, RAF, MEK and ERK.
We and others recently showed that colon tumors with concurrent activation of the MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways by separate mutations are invariably resistant to inhibition of either pathway alone, but sensitive to combined inhibition of both pathways.
Concurrent activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways occurs in a significant proportion of human CRCs.
To test whether the cap-dependent translation apparatus mediates the effects of ERK and AKT activation on CRC motility, the effects of MEK and AKT inhibition, alone or in combination, were determined in HCT116 cells with stable knockdown of 4E-BP1 or expressing control shRNA.
We uncover a molecular mechanism that involves the activation of MEK/ERK by mutant p53, leading to Egr-1 transcription.
Upon inhibition of MEK by PD98059, dephosphorylation of ERK by specific phosphatases occurs very rapidly (within minutes).
Because EGFR stimulates the ERK1/2 pathway, one of the major regulators of Egr-1 expression, the involvement of ERK-1/2 was examined using MEK inhibitor PD98059.
Overall, these results suggest that overexpression of Egr-1 results in an increased transcription and secretion of EGFR ligands, therefore initiating a positive feedback loop that leads to autocrine activation of the EGFR and MEK/ERK1/2.
Overall our results indicate that the MEK/ERK pathway mediates the activation of Egr-1 transcription by mutant p53.
Overexpression of Egr-1 is caused by mutation of p53 and appears to be initiated through activation of the MEK/ERK1/2 signaling cascade by mutant p53.

We show that activation of the Hedgehog (HH) pathway, critically involved in the pathogenesis of BCCs, as well as the EGFR/MEK/ERK/c-JUN signaling pathway suppresses miR-203.
The oncoprotein c-JUN, part of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, has been shown to synergize with HH/GLI1 in oncogenic transformation via activation of the MEK/ERK/JUN pathway.
These results indicate that activation of the EGFR/MEK/ERK/JUN signaling pathway is a possible mechanism underlying reduced miR-203 expression in a subset of BCCs.
Indeed, c-JUN has recently been described as a major downstream effector of the HH pathway, whose direct activation by GLI in synergism with the EGFR/MEK/ERK/JUN pathway is essential for oncogenic activity of HH signaling in skin.

There was strong rational for this approach since sorafenib targets EGFR-Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway as well as angiogenesis.
Our results show that the non-Smad downstream effectors p38MAPK and MEK/ERK regulate actin remodeling and cell motility, but do not contribute to the regulation of the Arp2/3 complex.
A gradual decrease in the level of the MEK1/2 phosphorylation was observed in the U0126-treated T47D cells at 1, 3 and 6 h, while it increased after 12 h. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2, on the other hand, was inhibited during the entire observation period and was not affected by activated MEK1/2.

Based on this we went on to study the effects on myeloma cells applying an inhibitor of MYC-MAX heterodimerization; the 10058-F4 compound.
Moreover, the 10058-F4 compound represents a new class of protein inhibitors because it does not inhibit enzyme activity but rather the bi-molecular interaction between c-MYC and its partner MAX.
