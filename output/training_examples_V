Raf then phosphorylates MAP kinase MEK1/2.
It has been demonstrated that MEK1, one of the two MEK isoforms in Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway, is essential for successful EV71 propagation.
Cellular ERK signaling pathway, one of the three major mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, which consists of three tiered serine/threonine kinases of Raf, MEK and ERK, plays an important role in regulating cell physiological functions [
Beside PI3K/Akt pathways, the Raf-MEK-MAPK signaling cascade is involved in JSRV-induced cell transformation, even though its role has not been completely elucidated.
In summary, available evidence supports the idea that JSRV Env induces transformation at least in part by the activation of the Akt and Raf-MEK-MAPK pathways.
In addition, to date, it is not known how JSRV Env initiates the signaling cascades resulting in the activation of the Akt and Raf-MEK-MAPK pathways.
Studies of the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase pathway show that upstream events (including Shc phophorylation and Shc-Grb2 complex formation), Ras activation, and activation of downstream components (including Raf-1, MEK, and the MAP kinases ERK1/2 and JNK) occur constitutively in both SFFV-P and SFFV-A-infected cells [
Structure-function studies have identified activated signaling pathways involved in oncogenic transformation, most notably the PI3K-Akt-mTOR and Ras-Raf-MEK-MAPK pathways.
Therefore we investigated the role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt survival signaling and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK proliferative signaling during RV-induced apoptosis in RK13 cells.
In contrast, inhibition of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway impaired RV replication and growth and reduced RV-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the normal cellular growth is required for efficient virus production.
The Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK is a classical MAPK pathway where growth factor-receptor interactions trigger intracellular activation of the small G-protein Ras.
Ras recruits and directly activates the MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKK) Raf, which phosphorylates and activates the MAPK kinase (MAPKK) MEK1/2, which in turn activate the MAPK ERK1/2.
Activation of PI3K-Akt and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling cascades during virus infection is thought to play an important role not only in cellular growth and survival, but also in virus replication and growth during both acute and chronic virus infections [
The effect of RV infection on PI3K-Akt and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathways was investigated by examining the expression and phosphorylation profiles of Akt, ERK1/2 and their downstream targets.

Lastly, HCV core protein signals through the p38 MAPK/ERK cascade, since it activates the Raf-1 kinase, a central component of the pathway that phosphorylates MEK1.

('STAT1', 'IRF1', 'increases')
We next determined whether STAT1 molecules in the nucleus were competent to bind the GAS element derived from the promoter of the IRF1 gene by EMSA.
Cytokines like CCL5, small inducible cytokine A2, IL8 and other immune responsive genes like STAT1, IRF1 and B2 M were found to be up-regulated at this time point post infection with seasonal influenza virus.

('DAG', 'PKC', 'increases_activity')
Hyperglycemia increases diacylglycerol (DAG) content, which activates PKC, primarily the b- and d-isoforms.
This results in increased flux of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to DAG, an activator of PKC, and of triose phosphates to methylglyoxal, the main intracellular AGE precursor.

('PI3K', 'FAK', 'adds_modification')
Focal adhesion kinases (FAK) and phophatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI3K) are two prominent intermediate signaling molecules.

It has been demonstrated that MEK1, one of the two MEK isoforms in Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway, is essential for successful EV71 propagation.
However, the distinct function of ERK1 and ERK2 isoforms, the downstream kinases of MEKs, remains unclear in EV71 replication.

Depending on the type of cell line studied, three main pathways have been shown to be activated in JSRV transformed cells; the PI3K/Akt pathway, the Hyal2-RON pathway, and the Ras-MEK-ERK pathway.
We also report an upregulation of MEK and ERK activation suggestive of a proliferative phenotype.
Therefore we investigated the role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt survival signaling and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK proliferative signaling during RV-induced apoptosis in RK13 cells.

The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) signaling pathway is involved in viral life cycle.
However, the effect of MEK/ERK pathway in enterovirus 71(EV71)-infected immature dendritic cells (iDCs) is still unclear.
Differential gene expressions of MEK/ERK signaling pathway molecules in EV71-infected iDCs were performed by PCR arrays.
PCR arrays showed that gene expressions of molecules in MEK/ERK signaling pathway were remarkably upregulated in EV71-infected iDCs.
EV71 infection activated both MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, which phosphorylated their downstream transcription factor c-Fos, c-Jun, c-myc and Elk1.
Our data suggest that the MEK/ERK signaling pathway plays an important role in EV71-infected iDCs and these molecules may be potential targets for the development of new anti-EV71 drugs.
To explore the roles of MEK/ERK signaling pathway in EV71-infected iDCs, we induced iDCs from PBMCs in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-4.
The iDCs were then infected with EV71 and used to investigate the effect and mechanism of MEK/ERK signaling pathway associated molecules during EV71 infection.

To our knowledge, this study is the first report to show the activation of MEK/ERK signaling pathway in EV71-infected iDCs.
The results provide evidences that the activation of MEK/ERK pathway may be associated with EV71 replication in iDCs.
Moreover, we found that inhibition of the MEK/ERK cascade could effectively reduce virus replication and lead to a diminished release of cytokines.
The upregulation of SOS1 expression might further activate MEK/ERK signaling pathway.
Together, these data demonstrate that MEK/ERK signaling pathway plays an important role in EV71-infected iDCs.
Therefore, understanding the fundamental mechanisms of EV71-induced activation of MEK/ERK signaling pathway is important for development of new antiviral drugs.
