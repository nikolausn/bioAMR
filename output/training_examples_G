('Raf', 'MEK', 'adds_modification')
HCC is characterized by the activation of the Raf/MEK/EPK pathway and is a highly angiogenic malignancy.
Receptor-bound arrestins serve as scaffolds for MAP kinase cascades, bringing together apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 (JNK3), as well as the kinase c-Raf-1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), thereby facilitating signaling in the ASK1-Map kinase kinase 4 (MKK4)-JNK3 and c-Raf-1-MAP/ERK kinase 1 (MEK1)-ERK2 pathways [
Some downstream events following receptor engagement include protein kinase C activation, signaling via the Raf-MEK-ERK and Rac2 pathways, the formation of reactive oxygen radicals by NADPH oxidase (phagocytic oxidase or PHOX) and migration of myeloperoxidase and the protease, neutrophil elastase, from granules.

However, LIF activates also parallel circuitries like the PI3K-pathway and the MEK/ERK-pathway, but its mechanisms of action remain to be better elucidated.

We have shown that once PI3K inhibition is removed, cells that have acquired GDC-0941 resistance also become resistant to MEK or ERK inhibition.
The loss of sensitivity to ERK and MEK inhibition can be restored if GDC-0941 is retained in the media, which prevents PI3K/AKT pathway activation.

ERK exists in two isoforms (1 and 2) which are activated by upstream kinase MEK1/2 (MKK1/2) and has been implicated in regulating the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of cells during development (reviewed in Widmann etal., 
This stimulates the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway which plays a pivotal role in the microglial mitotic response and contributes to the development of neuropathic pain.
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of differentially expressed genes of patients with no activating mutation in KRAS, BRAF and PI3KCA classified as oncogenic by the combined model (n=79) versus patients classified as wildtype-like (n=127) The ERK/MEK pathway can be activated by mutations in 
U0126 (a specific inhibitor of MEK-1/2, an upstream effector of ERK1/2) and EGCG suppressed the LPS-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and IL-12p40, IL-6, MCP-1, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 mRNA accumulations in BMMs (
Some downstream events following receptor engagement include protein kinase C activation, signaling via the Raf-MEK-ERK and Rac2 pathways, the formation of reactive oxygen radicals by NADPH oxidase (phagocytic oxidase or PHOX) and migration of myeloperoxidase and the protease, neutrophil elastase, from granules.
