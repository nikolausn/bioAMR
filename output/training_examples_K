('Raf', 'MEK', 'adds_modification')
This multikinase inhibitor showed an OS benefit via its antiangiogenic and antiproliferative effects on C- and B-Raf serine/threonine kinases (comprising the Raf/MEKL/ERK pathway), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) tyrosine kinases, and Flt-4 and c-Kit [
The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is one of the most important pathways in the control of cell proliferations.
In addition, represented by a thinner arrow in this model, UTD2 can moderately inhibit the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway.

('PI3K', 'PDK1', 'increases_activity')
The catalytic PI3K isoforms can be regulated by receptor tyrosine kinases and/or G protein-coupled receptors and activate AKT, serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase (SGK), phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and several other pathways that control a variety of cellular processes including proliferation, growth, apoptosis, migration, and metabolism

Moreover, the ERK1/2 upstream kinase MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 [
The activation of ERK was antagonized with a specific inhibitor of MAP kinase/ERK kinase kinase (MEKK), PD98059 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA), and the specific p38 MAP kinase inhibitor was SB203580 (Calbiochem).
This study attempted to elucidate the signal transduction pathway of adipocyte-derived stem cells (ASCs) by using a demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (ADC), to analyze the survivin, MEK/ERK, c-Myc and p53 gene expression.
Western blotting analysis was performed for p53, survivin, unphosphorylated and phosphorylated (p)-MEK, and p-ERK.
The overexpression of p-MEK/ERK, p53, and c-Myc increased the survivin protein expression of the demethylated ASCs.
These results suggest that demethylation could alter the expression of survivin, and p53, c-Myc and the MAPK (MEK/ERK) pathway might play a role in survivin's regulation in ASCs.
The primary antibodies against c-Myc, p53 and survivin were purchased from Dako (Amsterdam, Netherlands), ERK and MEK were purchased from Genzyme (San Francisco, CA, USA).
The levels of p-MEK and p-ERK were increased time-dependently, however these levels at 72 hr were decreased to lower than that of before treatment.
The levels of phosphorylated-MEK and -ERK were increased time-dependently, however the levels 72 hr after ADC treatment were decreased to lower than that before treatment.
In this study, ADC treatment significantly increased (P < 0.05) the expressions of MEK, ERK, c-Myc, p53 and survivin, as is evident from the immunoblotting and the corresponding densitometry data.
In conclusion, the overexpression of p-MEK and ERK, p53, and c-Myc increased the survivin protein expression of the demethylated ASCs.
This study presents evidence that the expression of multiple gene pathways controls this response, including the MEK, ERK, c-Myc and p53 genes.
Protein expression analysis of p-MEK, p-ERK, c-Myc, p53, and survivin in control and ADC-treated ASC as assess by immunoblotting and by their respective densitometry data.
The comparison of each protein level at 24, 48, 72 hr after and before ADC treatment is as follows: P-p-MEK = 0.08, P-p-ERK = 0.001, P-c-Myc = 0.003, P-p53 = 0.004, P-survivin = 0.031, P-p-MEK-survivin = 0.075, P-p-ERK-survivin = 0.010, P-c-Myc-survivin = 0.003, P-p53-survivin = 0.117.
Finally, we further examined the specific ability of p-ERK blockade in the NAcc on the inhibition of the expression of locomotor sensitization to cocaine by using another MEK inhibitor, U0126. 
The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is one of the most important pathways in the control of cell proliferations.
In addition, represented by a thinner arrow in this model, UTD2 can moderately inhibit the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway.
PD98059 is a specific inhibitor of mitogen activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEK-1), which is responsible for ERK1/2 activation.
