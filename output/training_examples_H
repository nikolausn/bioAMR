('Raf', 'MEK', 'adds_modification')
Tyrosine autophosphorylation of the intracellular domain of EGFR results in the recruitment of the GRB2/SOS signaling complex, GTP-loading of the proximate Ras, and subsequent activation of Raf kinase and a phosphorylation cascade from MEK to ERK.
Importantly, the ERK pathway resembles a negative feedback amplifier (NFA) with the amplifier consisting of the three-tiered kinase module Raf-MEK-ERK and negative feedbacks emanating from ERK to SOS and Raf; the ratio of protein abundances of Raf, MEK and ERK is about 1:3:6 [
Sorafenib is an anticancer drug that inhibits tumour cell proliferation through the Raf/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK signalling pathway, and tumour angiogenesis by targeting the receptor tyrosine kinases of vascular endothelial growth factors 2 and 3, and platelet-derived growth factor [

('BRAF', 'MEK1', 'adds_modification')
Children born with germ-line mutations in BRAF, MEK1 or MEK2 develop cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome, an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, heart defects, skin and hair abnormalities and mental retardation.

('PI3K', 'PDK1', 'increases_activity')
Downstream of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1) phosphorylates Akt at T308, what in conjunction with the mTORC2-mediated phosphorylation of Akt drives full activation of this kinase (
On the basis of the evidence accumulated, we propose that PTEN in oocytes suppresses follicular activation through negative regulation of the PI3K signaling and of the function of PDK1, which leads to subsequent inhibition of phosphorylation of S6K1 at T229 by PDK1 (

('DAG', 'PKC', 'increases_activity')
IKKs can be induced by FA via the activation of TLRs and PKC, and the latter can be activated by DAG.

('PI3K', 'FAK', 'adds_modification')
It is important that Src activation results in potentiation of EGF-R-mediated tumour growth by stimulating the same downstream pathways like FAK, STAT, and PI3K[

('BRAF', 'MEK2', 'adds_modification')

('MEK', 'ERK', 'adds_modification')
We have previously identified genes modulated by insulin in the liver and in liver-derived cells that have not yet been characterized as insulin regulated, and results of these previous studies indicated that numerous genes are induced by insulin via the MEK-ERK pathway.
In our prior reports it was demonstrated that the MEK-ERK pathway is required for the rapid insulin induction of c-fos, Pip92, Egr-1, ATF-3, Insig-1, and Krox20 transcription.
We have previously reported on the involvement of the MEK-ERK and p38 signaling pathways in insulin-regulated gene expression.
This finding, that insulin does not use the MEK-ERK pathway, contrasts with the published accounts on the involvement of MEK-ERK in Gadd45 gene expression.
For instance, MEK-ERK is necessary for the full induction of the Gadd45 promoter following UV-induced DNA damage in both HCTII6 human colorectal carcinoma cells and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells.
In this case, inhibition of either the MEK-ERK or the PI3-K pathways would be insufficient to completely reduce insulin-induced mTOR and therefore mTOR-dependent gene expression.
A number of mechanisms of resistance have been identified including reactivation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway.
Tyrosine autophosphorylation of the intracellular domain of EGFR results in the recruitment of the GRB2/SOS signaling complex, GTP-loading of the proximate Ras, and subsequent activation of Raf kinase and a phosphorylation cascade from MEK to ERK.
Importantly, the ERK pathway resembles a negative feedback amplifier (NFA) with the amplifier consisting of the three-tiered kinase module Raf-MEK-ERK and negative feedbacks emanating from ERK to SOS and Raf; the ratio of protein abundances of Raf, MEK and ERK is about 1:3:6 [

Perception of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (Ras/MAPK) signalling components, known for their role in signalling and cancer, has been altered by the discovery that germ-line mutations underlie a series of syndromes with overlapping features.
Phosphorylation of other components of the classical MAP kinase pathway upstream of ERK, among them BRAF and MEK, were not altered, nor were phosphorylation levels of the downstream kinase, RSK, or the transcription factor CREB.
To determine the mechanism of ERK phosphorylation in ZZ primary bronchial epithelial cells, we treated cells with U0126, a specific inhibitor of MEK, or an anti-EGFR blocking monoclonal antibody.
RASopathies, a family of disorders characterized by cardiac defects, defective growth, facial dysmorphism, variable cognitive deficits and predisposition to certain malignancies, are caused by constitutional dysregulation of RAS signalling predominantly through the RAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK) cascade.
Signalling elicited by activated cell surface receptors and transduced through RAS proteins to the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT cascades is central to cell proliferation, survival, differentiation and metabolism (
Mutations of genes coding for proteins with role in RAS signalling and the RAF/MEK/ERK cascade have been identified as the molecular cause underlying a group of clinically related developmental disorders, the RASopathies.
