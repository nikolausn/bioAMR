Preliminary meta-analysis of these publicly available datasets yields potential biomarkers from the P53 signaling pathway (CDKN1A, GADD45A, MDM2, PMAIP1), stress response transcription factors (ATF3, JUN, JUNB, JUND), and cell surface receptors (CD69, CD70, CD83).
Among the early response genes, mostly genes encoding proteins involved in the regulation of transcription processes were induced, such as v-jun sarcoma virus 17 oncogene homolog (avian) (JUN), jun B proto-oncogene (JUNB), v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog B (avian) (MAFB), RNA-binding region (RNP1, RRM) containing 2 (RNPC2), SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 4 (SOX4), tribbles homolog 3 (Drosophila) (TRIB3), Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6), zinc finger protein 184 (Kruppel-like) (ZNF184), activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), BTG family, member 2 (BTG2).

The down-regulation in Tat expressing cells is most apparent on cellular receptors that have intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity and signal transduction members that mediate RTK function, including Ras-Raf-MEK pathway.
The down-regulation is most apparent on cellular receptors that have intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity and signal transduction members that mediate RTK function; including the Ras-Raf-MEK pathway, and co-activators such as p300/CBP and SRC-1, which mediate gene expression related to hormone receptor genes.
A common intermediate pathway initiating from receptors to the nucleus is the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK (MAPK) cascade, which can result in the phosphorylation and activation of additional downstream kinases and transcription factors such as p90Rsk, CREB, Elk, and Egr-1 [
A) Down-regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) by Tat which modulates the phosphorylation and transcription of downstream effectors such as Ras, Raf, MEK, MAPK, and control transcription factor phosphorylation.
These genes belong to receptor, co-receptor, and co-activator pathways that are part of serine/threonine receptor tyrosine kinase, Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK (MAPK) cascade, which control proliferative and/or differentiation signals.
For example, MAP2K3, MAP2K6, p38, MAPKAPK2, MAPKAPK3, and HSP27 are involved in Actin reorganization, FAK and Paxillin are involved in Focal Adhesion Turnover, whereas GRB2, SHC, SOS, Ras, Raf1, MEK1, MEK2, ERK1, and ERK2 are involved in gene expression and cell proliferation.
Looking further downstream in the Cytoskeleton Remodeling-Integrin Outside-In Signaling pathway, both approaches failed to recover the phosphorylation of MEK1(MAP2K1) and MEK2(MAP2K2) by c-Raf-1, or the subsequent phosphorylation by both kinases of ERK1/2.
They indicate that the basal activation of MEKs and Erks in PEPs by minimal concentrations of Epo does not occur through the classical cascade Shc/Grb2/Sos/Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk.
Instead, MEKs and Erks are signal mediators of PI3K, probably the recently described PI3K gamma, through a Raf-independent signaling pathway which requires PKC activity.
However, Raf family kinases (c-Raf1, A-Raf, B-Raf), the classical effector proteins of Ras are not crucial for the subsequent activation of MEKs and Erks by Epo, while stimulation of c-Kit by stem cell factor (SCF) activates Erks in a Raf-dependent manner.
To determine whether Raf kinases are crucial for MEK and Erk activation, PEPs were pretreated with the compound ZM336372 (ZM), a potent and specific Raf inhibitor [
An alternative mechanism to activate MEKs and Erks independent of Rafs is through protein kinase C (PKC) family enzymes.

We were able to show inhibition of ERK phosphorylation in vitro by both, the MEK inhibitor CI-1040 and the Raf inhibitor BAY 43-9600.
Although both inhibitors reached comparable serum concentrations after intraperitoneal administration (data not shown), the MEK inhibitor was active in mice whereas the Raf inhibitor was not.
Why BAY 43-9006 is not active in our Raf dependent lung tumor mouse model and whether Raf and MEK might fulfill different functional roles with respect to lung adenoma formation needs to be further addressed in detail in future.

The Ras/Raf/MEK/extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) (Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)) signal transduction pathway is a crucial mediator of many fundamental biological processes, including cellular proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and migration.
The Ras/MAPK pathway is the best characterised of the mammalian MAPK signal transduction networks, consisting of the Ras proteins, a family of small G-coupled molecules, the Raf kinases (MAP3K), the MAP2K kinases (MEK1 and MEK2) and the pathway distil kinases ERK1 and ERK2.
The Raf family of serine/threonine kinases (A-, B- and c-Raf (Raf-1)) lie at the apex of the MEK/ERK pathway.
However, they differ in their ability to phosphorylate and activate MEK, with B-Raf demonstrating higher basal kinase activity compared with Raf-1 and A-Raf.
The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway has an established role in the various neoplastic phenotypes observed in many malignancies.

Curiously, mitochondrial Raf-1 did not activate the MEK-ERK pathway, but rather phosphorylated and inactivated BAD, a proapoptotic protein (
Using the Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathway as paradigm, we have highlighted some of these mechanisms including differential protein interactions, subcellular compartmentalisation, different modes of activation, and differential targeting of downstream effectors.
Potent Raf and MEK inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials.

The Raf/MEK/ERK cascade is the longest-studied and probably the best-described Ras effector pathway.
One outstanding feature of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in mammals is redundancy.
Mammals have three Raf isoforms (A-Raf, B-Raf and Raf-1, also known as C-Raf), two MEK and two ERK isoforms.
All three Rafs can bind to Ras and phosphorylate MEK, although B-Raf is much more efficient than the other two and is necessary for ERK activation 
Consistent with its prominent role as a MEK kinase, B-Raf is the component of the ERK pathway most often mutated in human tumours, with a particularly high frequency (43%) in human melanoma.
The most frequent B-Raf mutation, V600E, results in constitutive catalytic activity and MEK/ERK activation.

Although these data do not exclude that Raf-1 may have function(s) connected with its ability to phosphorylate MEK or other substrates, they do indicate that the essential role of Raf-1, at least in the epidermis, is independent of its kinase activity.
Downstream of Ras, Raf-1 is involved in at least two pathways: the canonical Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, where Raf-1 acts as an activator, likely in the context of a Ras-induced heterodimer with B-Raf; and the Rok-

The rescue of cell cycle progression in Rasless cells by activated BRAF or MEK1 resulted in the reversal of most such transcriptional mRNA and microRNA alterations.
Our analysis shows that the patterns of differential mRNA and miRNA expression in growth-arrested, Rasless cells are clearly interdependent and, in addition, that they can undergo specific reversal after recovery of the proliferative ability of such cells through the introduction of activated BRAF or MEK1 kinases.
Interestingly, rescue of the proliferative ability of the Rasless cells by expressing activated BRAF or MEK1 [
As mentioned in previous sections, more than 80% of the transcriptional alterations occurring in Rasless cells are reversed by activated BRAF or MEK1 molecules.
Restoring the proliferative ability of those cells after ectopic expression of activated BRAF or MEK1 resulted in the reversal of a large proportion of the transcriptional mRNA and miRNA alterations identified, indicating that the altered mRNA and miRNA expression patterns are functionally interrelated and specifically associated with the disappearance of the Ras proteins in Rasless cells.
This hypothesis would also predict that reversing the transcriptional patterns of mRNA and miRNA differential expression of Rasless cells may lead to a parallel restoration of their proliferative abilities, similar to what happens in BRAF- or MEK1-rescued MEFs.
The sample set used in this report for mRNA expression studies included 27 independent hybridizations corresponding to 14 controls, 7 Rasless, 3 BRAF-rescued and 3 MEK1-rescued samples.

('RB1', 'MYC', 'increases')
The non-mutator genes/regions containing MYC, KRAS, CCNE1 and RB1 have the smallest posterior mean time of alterations in most samples while the driver gene CSMD3, USH2A and the region containing MECOM, WWOX have large posterior means.
For the non-mutator genes/regions, the regions containing MYC, KRAS, CCNE1 and RB1 tend to alter early while the gene CSMD3, USH2A and the region containing MECOM, WWOX tend to alter late.
The selection of the oncogenome during mouse and human breast tumor development is markedly different, apart from the MYC gain and RB1-associated loss.
These networks included increased RB1 activity, decreased MYC activity, decreased TFRC activity, and increased FOXO1/FOXO3 activity.
These mechanisms include increasing FOXO transcriptional activity, inhibition of MYC transcriptional activity, decreased TFRC activity, and induction of RB1-mediated cell cycle arrest.
Predicted changes in the activity of core machinery involved in cell cycle regulation (RB1, CDKN1A, and MYC/MYCN) are statistically supported across multiple data sets, underscoring the general applicability of this approach for a network-wide biological impact assessment using systems biology data.

The apoptosis network regulated through FOXO3 and 4, and MYC binding, in concert with p38 MAPK signaling through ELK1, is unique to Cluster4.
Interestingly, the over-represented recognition sequence for MYC, ELK1, NF-Y, SP1, ATF, GABPA, SREBP-1, NF-E2, STAT5A, NF-1 as well as SOX-9 rank among the most conserved motifs found in human promoters[
The genes that occurred most frequently in the deregulated subnetworks are ATF4 (45), ELK1 (43), DDIT3 (39), MAP2K2 (38), MAPKAPK5 (37), ATF2 (36), MOS (36), TP53 (36), JUN (34), MAP2K7 (34), CDC25B (32), MAP2K3 (32), MAP3K10 (32), MYC (32), ELK4 (31), MAP2K1 (31) and MAPT (31).

('STAT1', 'IRF1', 'increases')
Prediction for potential targets of E2F, IRF1, ISGF3, HNF4, PPAR, SF-1 and STAT1 were done by combined PWM & SiteGA approach.
It should be noted that the experimentally confirmed BSs for IRF1, ISGF3, and STAT1 were identified in 39%, 29%, and 13% of these genes, respectively (Fig. 
There was a severalfold density excess of the putative BSs for the IRF1, ISGF3, and STAT1 in the [-400; -1] region of ISGs (see Additional file 
A predominant Th1 immune response was observed during infection, as 6 of 11 investigated Th1 associated genes, including TNF, IFNG, and some IFNG-signaling responsive genes (SOCS1, STAT1, WARS and IRF1), were strongly up-regulated at 24 hpi and/or 48 hpi (Fig. 
Our subsequent identification of STAT1 binding sites that are bound by RNApolII near the start positions of the IRF1 and IFNaR1 genes in non-stimulated cells suggested that basal levels of mRNA transcription might be detectable at these sites.
It is interesting to note that within the ENCODE region, STAT1 bound most closely to start positions of two genes with key roles in IFN signal transduction, IRF1 and IFNaR2 (Table 
Interestingly, two STAT1 binding sites upstream of two well characterized mediators of IFN signal transduction, IFNaR1 and IRF1, were the closest two STAT1 binding sites to the start of any gene in the ENCODE region (both were located less than 500 bp away).
Most of these genes were related and formed a large network, in which IL6, STAT1, MYD88, IRF1 and NFKB2 were key genes.
Combining network analysis with differential gene expression analysis helped to uncover high-confidence genes, such as IL6, TLR4, STAT1, MYD88, IRF1, and NFKB2, and several immune-related genes, such as IRF7, IFIT1, MX1, OASL, IFNGR1, and SOCS3, that have potentially important consequences to IBV infection.
The analysis of our kinetic model identified a significant role of the negative feedback from SOCS1 in driving the observed damped oscillatory dynamics, and of the positive feedback from IRF1 in increasing STAT1 basal levels.
To analyze the expression of regulatory genes of the type I IFN pathway, we measured the levels of two downstream STAT1 genes, SOCS1 (responsible of the negative feedback) and IRF1 (mediator of the positive feedback).
Our study indicates the importance of identifying the temporal dynamics of the concentration of certain key components of the JAK-STAT pathway, such as the phosphorylated form of the STAT1 protein, and of the expression of interferon-stimulated transcription genes like SOCS1 and IRF1, within the first 8 hours of IFN-beta administration.

('PI3K', 'PDK1', 'increases_activity')
Activated PI3K catalyzes the production of PtdIns-(3,4)-P2 and PtdIns-(3,4,5)-P3 helping to recruit Akt and PDK1 to the membrane, where it is phosphorylated by PDK1 
PDK1 is a key molecule that couples PI3K to cell proliferation and survival signals in response to growth factor receptor activation, and is oncogenic when expressed in mouse mammary epithelial cells.
PDK1 was first identified as a protein-Ser/Thr kinase that linked PI3K to Akt activation in response to growth factor receptor stimulation [
To determine the influence of the PI3K/PDK1 signaling pathway on MMP-2 activation, Comma/PDK1 cells were treated with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 
Inhibition of PI3K reduces MMP expression in Comma/PDK1 cells.
As S6RP has been reported to have three upstream activators, which are PDK1/p70S6K, mTORC1/p70S6K and Ras/ERK/RSK pathways, it is suggested that Ras/ERK/RSK is most likely to contribute to the maintenance of S6RP phosphorylation after blockade of both PI3K and mTORC1 signaling in these four canine cell lines 
[
There is great expectation that inhibitors of the PI3K-PDK1-Akt-mTOR signalling axis will have utility as anti-cancer drugs, as this signalling network is inappropriately activated in the majority of human cancers.
SGK (serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase) is closely related to Akt and controlled by identical upstream regulators {PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase), PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) and mTORC2 [mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) complex 2]}.
As for LKB1, a significant proportion of PDK1 is localized in the cytoplasm even following the activation of PI3K pathways, where it plays a critical role in phosphorylating cytosolic substrates, such as p70 S6K (S6 kinase) and RSK isoforms, that are not known to reside within membranes.
The phospholipid products of PI3K [phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3)], once produced, can activate phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) that leads to the activation of AKT/protein kinase B-like proteins (AKT1-3, with AKT1 being well studied) and serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinases (SGK1-3).
The IIS pathway is generally well conserved, with the main building blocks (INSR, PI3K, PDK1, AKT, FOXO) present in both mammals and invertebrates.
Activation of PI3K recruits PDK1/2 and AKT to the plasma membrane, resulting in activation of transcription factors, activation of glycogen synthetase, increased cell survival, and entry into the cell cycle by activating cyclin D1 (
Phosphorylated IRS1 binds and activates phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), leading to the activation of serine-kinase phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), which activates AKT1.

Our findings suggest that a major event in the ATL-induced cell death in MCL cells lies in the displacement of Akt and its upstream regulators PI3K, p-PDK1 and mTOR from lipid rafts. 
One of best-characterised downstream targets of PI3K is PKB/AKT, which becomes activated by PDK1-dependent phosphorylation (

Using a targeted molecular knockdown approach to interrogate the causal molecular underpinnings of EGFR-persistent activation, we found that lapatinib-resistant cells were no longer oncogene addicted to HER2-HER3-PI3K signaling, as seen in the parental lapatinib-sensitive cell lines, but instead were dependent on a heregulin (HRG)-driven HER3-EGFR-PI3K-PDK1 signaling axis.
The dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor drug, PF1502, inhibited PI3K as evidenced by decreased pPDK1, and effectively impaired activation of both TORC1 and TORC2 substrates.

Activation of PKCs is mediated by diacylglycerol (DAG), Ca
L-thyroxine activates a dual phospholipase pathway in a sequential and synchronized manner: phospholipase C initiates the DAG formation, and PKC mediates the integration of phospholipase D into the signaling response during the sustained phase of agonist stimulation.
In the present study, we have examined the nongenomic effect of thyroid hormones on DAG formation and PKC activation in liver cells.
The Robison article reports that three chimpanzee ESTs deposited in October 2007 (DC524857, DC519886 and CD524857) are consistent with the presence of the DAG-binding domain in chimpanzee PKC-zeta.
In this context it should be pointed out that Anamika et al report has identified the PB1/DAG binding/catalytic domain/PKC terminal domain architecture in two chimp kinases.
Then, DAG activates the intracellular protein kinase C (PKC) pathway, leading to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and IP3 stimulates the release of intracellular calcium.
The effect of hyper- and hypo-thyroidism on diacylglycerol/protein kinase C (DAG/PKC) signaling in cardiomiocytes has been determined.
In the present study, we have examined DAG level and PKC activity in liver and isolated membranes during sustained thyroid hormone stimulation and at different thyroid state of organism.
DAG is a lipid second messenger that is capable of activating conventional and novel protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms [
PKDs (Protein kinase Ds) are DAG (diacylglycerol)-stimulated serine/threonine protein kinases, originally classified as a sub-group of the PKC (protein kinase C) family [
PKD family members are activated by binding DAG to their regulatory domain and by PKC (protein kinase C)-mediated phosphorylation of two conserved serine residues in their catalytic domain in response to phospholipase C and DAG signalling [
Our findings suggest that the elevated DAG production by LIPA activated by increased supply of dietary lipids may represent the causal link between dietary fat-induced hepatic TAG accumulation and hepatic IR via the PKC
Since, the C2 region (calcium binding
domain) is absent in the novel PKC, they are generally activated
by DAG and PS.
The main signalling target for DAG in cells is PKC (protein kinase C) (Nishizuka, 
We then considered the possibility that DAG production and hence PKC stimulation could play a role in causing the secondary oscillations. 
It is remarkable that these dramatic effects of PKC can be inferred in the absence of any detectable DAG production in the plasma membrane of eggs during the time between the first and secondary Ca

Hyperglycaemia induced de novo synthesis of DAG in vascular cells leads to selective activation of PKC isozymes, especially PKC-b, which in turn phosphorylate proteins involved in endothelial function and neovascularisation.
DAG is a second messenger in PKC (protein kinase C) activation and PKC-mediated signal transduction.
DAG recruits PKC to the internal surface of the plasma membrane and weakens the inhibitory pseudosubstrate domains control of the PKC catalytic domain [
Among the different PKC isoforms, the conventional and the novel PKCs have been demonstrated to be activated by diacylglycerol (DAG) or phorbol esters or both (
DAG from PC-PLC activity might sustain long-term PKC activity and generates PtdOH via DAG kinase to regulate MAPK, mTOR, PI3K/Akt signalling for cell proliferation.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of a novel SFK inhibitor, dasatinib (BMS-354825), on SFK/FAK/p130CAS, PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR, Ras/Raf/MAPK and Stats pathways in 9 HCC cell lines.
Dasatinib inhibits the proliferation, adhesion, migration and invasion of HCC cells in vitro via inhibiting of Src tyrosine kinase and affecting SFK/FAK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt, but not Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and JAK/Stat pathways.
In this study, we hypothesize that dasatinib inhibits HCC by modulating SFK/FAK/p130CAS, PI3K//PTEN/Akt/mTOR, Ras/Raf/MAPK and/or Stats signaling pathways.
Dasatinib inhibits the proliferation, adhesion, migration and invasion of HCC cells in vitro via inhibiting Src and affecting SFK/FAK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt signaling pathways, but not Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and JAK/Stats pathways.
The present study identifies a sequence of molecular mechanisms by which ITGA5 expression or activation and downstream activation of FAK, ERK1/2 and PI3K signalling induce IGF2/IGFBP2 expression in hMSCs.

FAK-mediated actin remodeling resulted into subsequent glucose uptake via PI3K-dependent pathway.
FAK overexpression supports actin remodeling and subsequent glucose uptake in a PI3K dependent manner.
Earlier we had reported that FAK silencing develops insulin resistance via inactivation of PI3K activity [
They included the ROCK inhibitor, JNK inhibitor, PI3K inhibitor, FAK inhibitor and ERK inhibitor.
The inhibition by non-cytoxic doses of GLY of VSMCs migration was through its negative regulatory effects on phosphorylated ERK1/2, PI3K/AKT, and FAK.
Anti-ERK1/2, anti-PI3K, antifocal adhesion kinase (FAK), anti-p-FAK, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse IgG antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Co. (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
Mechanistically, GLY may occur through inactivation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, exerting inhibitory effects on FAK and pFAK protein expressions and inhibiting PI3K, and phospho-AKT levels, thereby decreasing the activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 leading to inhibition of metastasis of VSMCs (Figure

Integrin-ECM interactions predominantly act through integrin-linked kinase (ILK) or focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signalling pathways, and a subset of integrins have been shown to activate PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways [
Although not significant is that - due to broad inter-patient variability-TDF's expressed FAK, PYK and PI3K in higher levels when cultured on PLLA/Col-I blend nanofibers compared to PLLA nanofibers or glass surfaces.
Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is a classic downstream target of FAK and is composed of two subunits, of which the phosphorylation of the p85 subunit is important to its activation [
We stimulated podocytes with Angptl3 and found that the levels of p-Y397 FAK and p-P85 PI3K both increased (

Consistent with this observation, depletion of FAK by siRNA resulted in the inhibition of Src, ERK1/2, PI3K, and Akt activity.
In addition, the Src inhibitor, PP2, blocked the phosphorylation of FAK, ERK1/2, PI3K, and Akt.
Our data suggest that fibronectin-mediated activation of FAK that leads to lung cancer metastasis could occur through ERK or PI3K/Akt regulation of MMP9/calpain-2 or MMP9/RhoA activity, respectively.
In this study, we propose that fibronectin-induced stimulation of FAK that causes lung cancer cell migration and invasion occurs by the activation of MMP9/calpain-2 and MMP9/RhoA through the ERK and PI3K/Akt signalling pathways, respectively.
p-FAK (Tyr925), p-Src (Tyr416), Src, p-PI3K p85 (Tyr458)/p55 (Tyr199), PI3K p85, p-Akt (Ser473), p-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), and RhoA (67B9) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology Inc (Danvers, MA, USA).
To examine the potential involvement of PI3K in FAK signalling, we examined the effect of the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, on the migration and invasion of A549 cells.
To summarise our results, fibronectin-stimulated A549 cell migration and invasion is achieved through the activation of FAK, which regulates calpain/MMP-9 and RhoA/MMP9 expression through ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signalling, respectively (
Thus, it seems that FAK promotes A549 lung cancer cell migration and invasion in concert with Src and subsequent activation of the ERK and PI3K/Akt signalling pathways.
In summary, we provide compelling evidence that fibronectin-induced A549 cell migration and invasion occurs through the activation of FAK, which then regulates MMP-9 expression through ERK or PI3K, as well as calpain-2 and RhoA expression through ERK and PI3K, respectively.
FAK promotes A549 lung cancer cells migration and invasion through Src, ERK, and PI3K/Akt.
Src is required for the activation of FAK and its downstream targets, ERK and PI3K/AKT during fibronectin-induced migration and invasion.
Fibronectin-stimulated A549 cell migration and invasion is achieved through the activation of FAK, which regulates calpain/MMP-9 and RhoA/MMP9 expression through ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signalling, respectively.
Because G-protein-coupled receptors transduce signals through diverse signalling pathways, including activation of FAK, PI3K/Akt, and ERK (
This is supported by a former study that Pyk2 has a compensatory function in promoting FAK-null mammary CSC tumourigenicity and metastatic activity with the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway as a major mediator (
This increased chemoresistance was at least partially mediated through PI3K/Akt signalling, and was paralleled by increased FAK phosphorylation, enhanced expression of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (XIAP and Livin) and suppression of the proapoptotic markers (caspase 9, caspase 3 and PARP).
It was previously reported that focal adhesion kinase (FAK) can regulate integrin-mediated survival in epithelial cells mainly through the PI3K/AKT pathway (

Immunostaining for Ki67, p53, and the molecular markers HER2, CK5/6, CK14, EGFR, FOXA1, GATA3, and P-cadherin was examined hormone receptor (HR)-positive cancer tissues from 150 patients.
The antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-p53 antibody (DO-7, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), mouse monoclonal anti-Ki67 antibody (MIB-1, Dako), mouse monoclonal anti-FOXA1 antibody (2D7, Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan), mouse monoclonal anti-GATA3 antibody (HG3-31, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) mouse monoclonal anti-CK5/6 antibody (D5/16 B4, Dako), mouse monoclonal anti-CK14 antibody (LL002, NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA, USA), mouse monoclonal anti-P-cadherin antibody (56C1, Novocastra, Newcastle, UK), and a mouse monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody included in an EGFR pharmDX kit (Dako).
For p53, FOXA1, and GATA3, cells with immunostaining in the nucleus were defined as positive, while for CK5/6, CK14, and P-cadherin, cells with immunostaining along the cellular periphery and/or in the cytoplasm were defined as positive.
An example for two genes - FOXA1 and GATA3 - is shown in Figure 
The normalized expression of the same two genes, FOXA1 and GATA3, was compared between experiments run on two array platforms: cDNA array, Sorlie 295 [
In addition, it also detected the activity difference of two other breast cancer associated TFs, FOXA1 and GATA3, in ER+ versus ER- samples.
We applied REACTIN to compare ER+ with ER- samples in ten breast cancer datasets and successful detected the activity difference of ER alpha, FOXA1 and GATA3 between ER+ and ER- breast cancer subtypes.
Analysis of ChIP-seq transcription factor binding sites shows clustering of ZNF217 with FOXA1, GATA3 and ERalpha binding sites, supported by the enrichment of corresponding motifs for the ERalpha-associated cis-regulatory sequences.
The function of ER binding at chromatin regions and transcriptional regulation is strongly influenced by GATA3 and FOXA1 [
Interestingly, ZNF217 and GATA3-FOXA1 are associated with opposite tumor phenotypes.
In contrast to GATA3 and FOXA1, the ZNF217 gene is amplified at 20q13 in ~20% of breast tumors and is associated with aggressive breast disease [
These markers were luminal-related markers ER, PR, AR, FOXA1 and GATA3 transcription factors, proliferation-related Ki67 and CCND1, ERBB2, anti-apoptotic BCL2 and P53.

('PI3K', 'AKT1', 'adds_modification')
AKT1 (AKT) is a downstream effecter of PIK3C2A (PI3K).
The phospholipid products of PI3K [phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3)], once produced, can activate phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) that leads to the activation of AKT/protein kinase B-like proteins (AKT1-3, with AKT1 being well studied) and serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinases (SGK1-3).
The potential association between impairment in the regulation of
PI3K signalling pathway mediated by AKT1 and the pathogenesis
of OSCC has been recently suggested [
We tested the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway because AKT (aka 
AKT1 of the protein kinase B [PKB] family) promotes several 
types of cancer by acting as an anti-apoptotic factor.
Phosphorylated IRS1 binds and activates phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), leading to the activation of serine-kinase phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), which activates AKT1.
Moreover, using proteomic approaches to analyze the differential protein expression patterns resulted from the chitosan nanoparticle uptaken by HepG2 and CCL-13 cells identified several proteins involved in the PI3K/AKT1/mTOR pathway.
In this study, the main finding of chitosan nanoparticle treated cells is the chitosan nanoparticles enhancing the PI3K/AKT1/mTOR pathway in Hep-G2 cells which may result in tumor metastasis.
Using the protein-protein interaction pathway analysis, those six proteins were related to the PI3K/AKT1/mTOR pathway (
However, according to the proteomics analysis, chitosan nanoparticle induced the liver cancer cell to secret several proteins which may active or enhance PI3K/AKT1/mTOR pathway.
The PI3K/AKT1/mTOR pathway was related to the cancer call metastasis and proliferation.
Although there are no direct evidences to prove the relevance between chitosan nanoparticle and PI3K/AKT1/mTOR pathway in our study, it is still worth to be considered, especially as an anticancer drug delivery system.
The PI3K phosphorylates PtdIns(4,5)P2 (PIP2) into PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (PIP3), which binds to the pleckstrin homology domain of the downstream target, v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homologue 1 (AKT1).
The E17K substitution in AKT1 is an important mechanism that leads to a PI3K-independent activation of AKT1 (
Inhibitors of PI3K, MEK/ERK, mTOR, as well as siRNAs to AKT1 and AKT2 enhance 
Many agents in development target PI3K or SRC, and further options exist for activities downstream of the action of PI3K, such as AKT1 and mTOR.
Interestingly, a large panel of activating mutations is found in the mTOR pathway, including PI3KCA (the PI3K catalytic subunit alpha isoform), AKT1 and mTOR mutations, as well as PTEN loss.

('SHC', 'GRB2', 'binds')
For example, MAP2K3, MAP2K6, p38, MAPKAPK2, MAPKAPK3, and HSP27 are involved in Actin reorganization, FAK and Paxillin are involved in Focal Adhesion Turnover, whereas GRB2, SHC, SOS, Ras, Raf1, MEK1, MEK2, ERK1, and ERK2 are involved in gene expression and cell proliferation.
The activated IGF1R phosphorylates SHC, which binds to RET and growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), leading to activation of RAS-MAPK signaling.
First, we assumed that in the absence of any treatment (i.e., experimental controls) the ligands, receptors, the adaptor proteins (GRB2 and SHC), the insulin receptor substrates (IRS and IRS-2), and non-ligand receptors (ErbB2 and ErbB3) have

Looking further downstream in the Cytoskeleton Remodeling-Integrin Outside-In Signaling pathway, both approaches failed to recover the phosphorylation of MEK1(MAP2K1) and MEK2(MAP2K2) by c-Raf-1, or the subsequent phosphorylation by both kinases of ERK1/2.
The inhibitory activity of RKIP on the Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway is, at least in part, regulated by PKC-induced phosphorylation of RKIP at serine 153 [
These include the Raf-1, MEK1/2 and ERKs pathways[
Pretreatment with U0126 also abrogated the effects of EA at acupoints on pMEK1/2, pERK1/2, pp90RSK, pBad, and NeuN expression, but did not influence BDNF and pRaf-1 expression.
Overall, our study results indicated that EA at acupoints, initiated 1 d postreperfusion, upregulates BDNF expression to provide BDNF-mediated neuroprotection against caspase-3-dependent neuronal apoptosis through activation of the Raf-1/MEK1/2/ERK1/2/p90RSK/Bad signaling cascade after 3 d of reperfusion in mild MCAo.
Previous studies have well-described that BDNF promotes cortical neuron survival in response to ischemic insult through activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which includes Raf-1, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation [
In this study, EA at acupoints, initiated 1 d postreperfusion, effectively upregulated BDNF expression to provide BDNF-mediated neuroprotection against neuronal apoptosis through phosphorylation of the Raf-1/MEK1/2/ERK1/2/p90RSK/Bad signaling cascade after 3 d of reperfusion.
For example, Raf-1 has been proposed to induce the phosphorylation of proteins that control apoptosis independently of MEK and ERK [
EGF-stimulated increases in survivin protein were abrogated in the presence of downstream inhibitors of the Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway.

Raf-1 is associated ubiquitously in the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway.
Despite numerous reported differences, it does appear that diverse GPCRs share common mechanistic themes during ERK stimulation, including the tyrosine-phosphorylation of Shc and its complexing with Grb2, mSOS recruitment, the GTP-loading of Ras, and Raf-1 activation leading to MEK-1 phosphorylation [
EGF-mediated induction of survivin requires the activity of Raf-1 and MEK/ERK, but EGF has no significant effect on survivin transcription.
A major outcome of TCR-mediated assembly of the ESC is activation of the MAPK ERK via the canonical Ras/Raf-1/MEK pathway.
ET-1[1-32] activates the Ras/Raf-1 kinase/MEK/ERK 1/2 signaling pathway.
Activated Raf-1 phosphorylates and activates MEK, which in turn phosphorylates and activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK).
In order to discover novel therapies targeting the Ras/Raf/ MEK/ERK pathway, screening for Raf-1 kinase inhibitory activity was initiated in 1995 by Bayer and Onyx (

The Raf family of serine/threonine kinases (A-, B- and c-Raf (Raf-1)) lie at the apex of the MEK/ERK pathway.
However, they differ in their ability to phosphorylate and activate MEK, with B-Raf demonstrating higher basal kinase activity compared with Raf-1 and A-Raf.
Knocking out MEK-1 results in an embryonic lethal phenotype which is similar, but not identical to the Raf-1 knockout (
Curiously, mitochondrial Raf-1 did not activate the MEK-ERK pathway, but rather phosphorylated and inactivated BAD, a proapoptotic protein (
This process involves activation of the cytoplasmic serine-threonine kinase Raf-1, which phosphorylates and activates mitogen activated kinase kinase mitogenic extracellular kinase (MEK), which in turn phosphorylates and activates ERK1/2 (p44/p42) on tyrosine and threonine residues.
We have chosen to develop an endpoint for drugs, which act on the Raf-1-MEK-ERK signal transduction pathway.
Our results suggest that choline could be used as a non-invasive PET or MRS imaging probe to monitor the effects of geldanamycin analogues, which target the tyrosine kinase receptor-Ras-Raf-1-MEK-ERK cascade.
Moreover, the activity of Raf-1 and MEK-1 protein kinases, the activators upstream MAPK in the phosphorylation cascade induced by EGF, was not modified in 8-Cl-cAMP-treated cells.
Mammals have three Raf isoforms (A-Raf, B-Raf and Raf-1, also known as C-Raf), two MEK and two ERK isoforms.
Although these data do not exclude that Raf-1 may have function(s) connected with its ability to phosphorylate MEK or other substrates, they do indicate that the essential role of Raf-1, at least in the epidermis, is independent of its kinase activity.
Downstream of Ras, Raf-1 is involved in at least two pathways: the canonical Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, where Raf-1 acts as an activator, likely in the context of a Ras-induced heterodimer with B-Raf; and the Rok-
Activated Raf-1 then phosphorylates the protein kinases MEK1 and MEK2, which in turn activate mitogen-activated protein kinase/ extracellular signal-related kinase (MAPK/ERK), a sequence of events that results in the transcription of target genes that are involved in cell proliferation [
In the ERK1/ERK2 module, growth factor derived extracellular signals are translated to Raf-1 activation, which leads to the phosphorylation of MAP kinase kinase (MEK)1 and MEK2; these in turn phosphorylate and activate ERK1 and ERK2.
Inhibitors of c-Raf-1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) have also been identified by screening, and have subsequently been optimised into drugs that are now in clinical trials [

('AR', 'FOXA1', 'increases')
START WITH name_in = 'FOXA1_HUMAN'
FOXA1 expression, androgen receptor (AR) expression, and the relationships of these two markers with clinicopathological factors were determined by immunohistochemistry analysis.
FOXA1 and AR were up-regulated by transient transfection with plasmids, and were down-regulated by transfection with siRNA or short hairpin RNA (shRNA).
We found that the expression of FOXA1 and AR in ECs was significantly higher than that in a typical hyperplasia and normal tissues.
FOXA1 expression was significantly correlated with AR expression in clinical tissues.
Moreover, the expression of XBP1, MYC, ZBTB16, and UHRF1, which are downstream targets of AR, was promoted by FOXA1 up-regulation or inhibited by FOXA1 down-regulation.
Co-immunoprecipitation showed that FOXA1 interacted with AR in EC cells.
ChIP-PCR assays showed that FOXA1 and AR could directly bind to the promoter and enhancer regions upstream of MYC.
Mechanistic investigation revealed that over-expression of Notch1 and Hes1 proteins by FOXA1 could be reversed by AR depletion.
In addition, we showed that down-regulation of AR attenuated FOXA1-up-regulated cell proliferation.
These results suggest that FOXA1 promotes cell proliferation by AR and activates Notch pathway.
It indicated that FOXA1 and AR may serve as potential gene therapy in EC.
In the present study, we investigated the dependency of AR on FOXA1 expression in tissue paraffin sections, in multiple cellular contexts, and on tumor-bearing nude mice.
Here we show, for the first time, that FOXA1 activates the Notch pathway through AR and that AR is required for FOXA1-enhanced cell proliferation in EC.
Staining was performed on paraffin-embedded specimens using primary antibodies as follows: anti-FOXA1 (1:200; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and anti-AR (1:50; Abcam).
MFE-296 cells stably transfected with shFOXA1 or NC were transiently cotransfected with PWP1/GFP/Neo-AR (exAR) or its negative control (NC).
AN3CA cells were transiently transfected with exFOXA1 or NC or cotransfected with a siRNA targeting AR (siAR) (Genephama Biotech, Shanghai, China) or its negative control (NC) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using Lipo2000 (Invitrogen).
AN3CA cells were transiently transfected with exAR or NC or cotransfected with siFOXA1 or NC in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) using Lipo2000 (Invitrogen).
Primary antibodies were as follows: anti-FOXA1 (1:200; Abcam), anti-AR (1:50, Abcam), anti-Notch1 (1:100; Epitomics,), anti-Hes1 (1:250; Epitomics), anti-Ki67 (1:100; Boster, Wuhan, China), and anti-PCNA (1:100; Boster).
We assessed relative FOXA1 and AR levels in EC samples, atypical hyperplasias, and normal endometrial tissue samples using immunohistochemistry.
We used western blotting to examine FOXA1 and AR expression in EC cells.
We next manipulated FOXA1 expression and examined its influence on AR expression.
We next examined whether the FOXA1 level impacted the expression of AR target genes in EC cells.
To investigate whether FOXA1 affects AR-mediated transcription through binding to AR, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments.
Pathway analysis in liver cancer shows that FOXA1/AR dual target genes are most involved in the cellular growth/proliferation pathway [
To directly address whether the effects of FOXA1 in promoting EC cell proliferation can be attributed to its activation of AR, a rescue experiment in MFE-296 cells was performed.
To explore the role of FOXA1 in the regulation of metastatic function and to determine whether AR is involved in FOXA1-mediated regulation of metastatic function, we examined the migration and invasion ability of MFE-296/shFOXA1 and AN3CA/exFOXA1 cells after exAR or siAR cotransfection using transwell migration and invasion assays.
Most FOXA1 studies have focused on its role as a pioneer factor that binds to DNA packaged in chromatin and opens the chromatin for binding of additional transcription factors including AR [
Although the underlying mechanisms governing the FOXA1-AR correlation in tumor progression are not fully understood, a pathway analysis showed that 187 FOXA1/AR dual target genes were involved in the cellular growth/proliferation pathway in liver cancer [
We further investigated the effects of FOXA1 and AR on migration and invasion of EC cells, and found that neutralization of AR activity did not inhibit FOXA1-enhanced cancer cell migration or invasion.
These observations indicate that the promoting effect of FOXA1 on migration and invasion is not dependent on AR.
Our findings in migration and invasion assays are consistent with our findings in immunohistochemical staining, which showed that higher expression of FOXA1 but not AR is found in tumors that displayed a greater depth of myometrial invasion.
These results suggest that AR is not the only downstream target of FOXA1 in EC.
In summary, our results suggest a new mechanism for the development of EC, in which FOXA1 promotes tumor cell proliferation through AR and activates the Notch pathway by influencing AR expression.
The newly identified FOXA1-AR interaction will help further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying EC progression and suggests that FOXA1 and AR are potential targets for EC treatment.
AR is a necessary medium in FOXA1-enhanced Notch pathway activation.
Our results with both BCRI and GS combined with RBNA also support the role of FOXA1 interacting with AR in this phenotype.
FOXA1 is known to have a role in potentiating steroid receptor transcription regulation, and its association with AR by immunohistochemistry has been reported by several other investigators [
The interaction with drugs of some transcription factors, such as PPAR and FOXA1, and how this interaction can be an attractive therapeutic approach, has also been evaluated.

FOXA1 (Forkhead box protein A1), a member of the forkhead class of DNA-binding proteins, is a pioneer factor facilitating the recruitment of ER and AR to their response elements on the genome.

Western blotting was used to compare the phosphorylation status of components of the PI3K-PKB, MEK-ERK and mTOR-p70S6K signalling pathways, as indices of pathway utilisation.
Utilisation of the PI3K-PKB, MEK-ERK and mTOR-p70S6K signalling pathways in melanoma, as determined by phosphorylation of signalling components, varies widely across a series of cell lines, and does not directly reflect mutation of genes coding these components.

PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathways are thought to be the central transducers of oncogenic signals in solid malignancies, and there has been a lot of enthusiasm for developing inhibitors of these pathways for cancer therapy.
The PI3K-AKT and RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathways are thought to play a central role in transmitting these oncogenic signals.
The high frequency of cancer-associated genetic alterations causing constitutive activation of PI3K-AKT and RAF-MEK-ERK and the addiction of cancer cells to their signals have led to enthusiasm for developing inhibitors of these pathways.
The PI3K-AKT and RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathways are thought to be the central mediators of oncogenic signals in solid malignancies.
The interconnectivity of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR and RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathways makes the idea of their concurrent dual inhibition an appealing one.
Previous studies have suggested that the PI3K-AKT-mTOR and RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway signals converge at 4E-BP1, and that its inhibition may be a major determinant of the efficiency of dual inhibition [

Inhibition of the MEK/ERK, but not PI3K or mTOR, pathway reduced the expression of PDF and MAP1D in both colon and lung cancer cell lines.
This is the first report showing that PDF is over-expressed in breast, colon, and lung cancers, and the first evidence that the MEK/ERK pathway plays a role in regulating the expression of PDF and MAP1D.
To understand potential mechanisms that regulate PDF and MAP1D gene expression, we used pharmacological inhibitors to target the MEK/ERK, PI3K, and mTOR signaling pathways and determined their effects on PDF or MAP1D expression.
Our data suggest that the MEK/ERK pathway contributes to the expression of PDF and MAP1D colon cancer cells.

Expression levels of proteins related to the RAF/MEK/ERK and STAT3 pathways and to cell cycle progression (cyclin D1) were determined by western blot analysis.
The RAF/MEK/ERK and STAT3 pathways were blocked and cyclin D1 expression was down regulated significantly in both cell lines by sorafenib; whereas, the kinase pathways were hardly affected by 5-FU, and cyclin D1 expression was up regulated.
Sorafenib appears to reduce sensitivity to 5-FU through down regulation of cyclin D1 expression by inhibiting RAF/MEK/ERK and STAT3 signaling, resulting in G1-phase arrest and reduction of the S-phase cell subpopulation when 5-FU is administrated after sorafenib, in which situation, combination treatment of the two agents results in antagonism; on the other hand, when sorafenib is administrated afterward, it can continue to work since it is not cell cycle specific, as a result, combination treatment of the two agents shows an additive-to-synergistic effect.
To identify the molecule mechanism of interactions between sorafenib and 5-FU, expression levels of proteins related to RAF/MEK/ERK and STAT3 pathways and to cell cycle progression (cyclin D1) were measured.
Our data reveal that sorafenib efficiently blocks STAT3 and RAF/MEK/EKR pathways, showing down regulation of p-C-RAF, p-ERK, and p-STAT3, while 5-FU shows almost no effect.
Signaling through RAF/MEK/ERK plays a crucial role in cell proliferation, differentiation, malignant transformation, and apoptosis [
From our experimental results and what is known in the literature, we conclude that (1) sorafenib and 5-FU both possess antitumor activity in HCC cells; (2) compared with 5-FU monotherapy, combination treatment with sorafenib and 5-FU shows weaker effects when sorafenib is followed by 5-FU, while the effect is stronger when 5-FU is followed by sorafenib; and (3) sorafenib pretreatment reduces the sensitivity of HCC cells to 5-FU by down regulating cyclin D1 expression via inhibition of RAF/MEK/ERK and STAT3 signaling, which in turn results in G1-phase arrest and S-phase reduction.

RA may play a role in enhancing ERK phosphorylation via MEK1/2 or its upstream but not in an FGF-signaling-dependent manner.
Based on the above, we propose that one possible mechanism of how RA promotes neural lineage entry by ESCs is that it enhances ERK phosphorylation via MEK1/2 or its upstream but not via a mechanism that is dependent on FGF signaling, and blockade of RA signaling may affect the activation of the upstream of ERK1/2, which leads to failure of neural specification of ESCs, even with the stimulation of FGF signaling (Figure 
The ET-1-induced activation of ERK1/2 was completely abolished by MEK1/2 inhibitors U0126 and SL327, and partially inhibited by the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059.

Angiogenic activation was assessed by ELISA against phosphorylated proteins AKT, MEK1/2, ERK1/2, SAPK/JNK and p38-MAPK.
We then investigated the phosphorylation status of AKT1, ERK1/2, MEK1/2, p38-MAPK and SAPK/JNK after pre-treatment with papain and found a modulation of phosphorylation levels of AKT1, MEK1/2, p38-MAPK and SAPK/JNK (down-regulated) and ERK1/2 (up-regulated).
This effect is likely caused by interference with key signaling pathways AKT, MEK, ERK1/2, p38-MAPK and SAPK/JNK signaling.

Pretreatment with U0126 also abrogated the effects of EA at acupoints on pMEK1/2, pERK1/2, pp90RSK, pBad, and NeuN expression, but did not influence BDNF and pRaf-1 expression.
Overall, our study results indicated that EA at acupoints, initiated 1 d postreperfusion, upregulates BDNF expression to provide BDNF-mediated neuroprotection against caspase-3-dependent neuronal apoptosis through activation of the Raf-1/MEK1/2/ERK1/2/p90RSK/Bad signaling cascade after 3 d of reperfusion in mild MCAo.

MEK: MAPK/ERK kinase
Is this due to the VEGFR blockage, inhibition of RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, or off target effects?
Finally, we investigated the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, testing the expression of two members of this pathway (
It is well known that phosphorylated ERK (pERK) is a key downstream component of the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.
The pERK protein is best known as a key downstream component of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway.
To more directly determine the relationship between pERK expression and sensitivity to sorafenib, we inhibited the MEK/ERK pathway and reduced basal pERK expression in MHCC97-H cells via U0126, a selective inhibitor of MEK 1 and MEK 2 [
It is well known that the RAF/MEK/ERK cascade is a key signaling pathway involved in the regulation of normal mammalian cell proliferation, survival and differentiation.
Raf serine/threonine kinases phosphorylate and activate the MEK1/2 dual-specificity protein kinases, which then phosphorylate and activate ERK1/2.
The pERK protein is a key downstream component of the MEK/ERK cascade.
In this study, basal levels of pERK were determined by immunocytochemical analysis and western blot analysis in order to evaluate the activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway in four types of HCC cell lines with different metastatic potential.
The results revealed that basal pERK levels increased stepwise in cell lines in accordance with their metastatic potential, indicating that the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway may be involved in tumor invasion and metastasis in HCC, consistent with results of previous studies [
Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that inhibits the Raf serine-threonine kinases and blocks the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.
It is possible that the antitumor activity of sorafenib might be due to its ability to inhibit angiogenesis-related tyrosine kinases as well as other RAF/MEK/ERK-independent mechanisms.
For example, Raf-1 has been proposed to induce the phosphorylation of proteins that control apoptosis independently of MEK and ERK [
To more directly determine the relationship between pERK expression and sensitivity to sorafenib, we used U0126, a selective inhibitor of MEK 1/2, to inhibit the MEK/ERK pathway and reduce basal pERK expression in MHCC97-H cells without influencing cell proliferation.
These observations are perfectly consistent with our hypothesis that the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway is essential for sorafenib-mediated growth inhibition and that sensitivity to sorafenib is directly related to the activation of this pathway and basal pERK expression.
Thus, the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway may be involved in the development of drug resistance to traditional chemotherapy in HCC, as reported in previous studies in other types of cancer.
These experiments demonstrate that the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway might be involved in drug resistance to traditional chemotherapy in HCC cell lines.

The first signaling molecule in the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway, Raf, is a serine/threonine kinase existing in three different isoforms (A-, B-, and C-Raf) with a common activator, Ras, and a single known common substrate, MEK.
MEK1/2 is a serine/threonine protein that phosphorylates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2).
Here we explored the role of the MEK/ERK pathway in receptor expression following ischemic brain injury using the specific MEK1 inhibitor U0126.
We subsequently assessed if MEK1 inhibition altered the cerebrovascular activation of pERK1/2 and pElk-1 in the vascular smooth muscle cells after MCAO.
Administration of the MEK1 inhibitor U0126, acting upstream of ERK1/2, abolished their activation as well as the enhanced receptor expression, and reduced the infarct volume.
If the MEK1 inhibitor was given 12 hours after the start of the reperfusion there were no significant changes in infarct volume, neurology score or receptor expression but still the MAPK pERK1/2 and the transcription factor pElk-1 levels were depressed.
This agrees with a previous study that showed a transient (within the first hours) increase in the MEK/ERK pathway located to neurons and astrocytes in conjunction with focal ischemia (but not studied before in cerebral vasculature); systemic administration of U0126 inhibited this response [
Our observations are in agreement with the diminished activity of the downstream MAPK MEK/ERK pathway and its transcription factor Elk-1, as well as the reduced expression of specific vascular receptor proteins both in large cerebral vessels and in microvessels.
Although the MEK/ERK pathway plays a crucial role in brain injury after ischemia and reperfusion, we provide here the first direct evidence of an associated vascular mechanism, involving both large cerebral arteries and brain microvessels.
PD98059 is a selective inhibitor of the MEK kinase pathway, kinase upstream of ERK.
Here we have investigated the role of ERK activation in the behavioral sensitization induced by repeated administration of psychostimulants in mice, using SL327, a brain-penetrating selective inhibitor of MAP-kinase/ERK kinase (MEK), the enzyme that selectively activates ERK.
Our results show that blockade of the ERK pathway by the MEK inhibitor SL327 has limited effects on the acute locomotor responses to cocaine or D-amph, but prevents the induction of sensitization induced by repeated administration of these drugs, as well as the conditioned locomotor responses in the environment previously paired with drug injection.
To evaluate the role of the ERK pathway in the behavioral responses to psychostimulants, we used systemic administration of the MEK inhibitor SL327 that crosses the blood-brain barrier [
The acute locomotor responses were only moderately affected by the pharmacological blockade of ERK pathway by systemic administration of the selective MEK inhibitor, SL327.
These data are the first to show that the elevated vascular expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1, associated with breakdown of the blood-brain barrier following focal ischemia, are transcriptionally regulated via the MEK/ERK pathway.
Previously, immunocytochemical and western blot analyses showed that MCAO with reperfusion caused activation of the MEK/ERK pathway in cerebral vessels associated with the ischemic region [
Next, we assessed whether the MEK/ERK pathway was activated in the walls of the MCA, the microvessels, and surrounding brain tissue following MCAO.
Furthermore, our data show that this upregulation is associated with upregulation of pERK1/2 and normalized by inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway.
Although MEK/ERK-pathway mechanisms play a crucial roles in mediating brain injury after ischemia and reperfusion, and inhibiting this pathway can reduce the infarct size [
This dosage is much higher than that necessary to inhibit the MEK/ERK pathway in cell culture but is necessary to allow a sufficient dosage to reach the abluminal side of the BBB; this was verified by protein expression using both immunohistochemistry and western blot.
We hypothesise that MEK/ERK inhibition might represent a way to prevent stroke-induced pathology because it targets several transcriptional mechanisms activated by cerebral ischemia, such as receptor upregulation, which causes enhanced contractility, and MMP-9 and TIMP1 activation, which affect the function of the BBB.
Inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway applied as late as 6 hours after the start of reperfusion significantly reduced the infarct volume and the expression of BBB-associated proteins MMP-9 and TIMP1 in the cerebral vessel walls.
Thus, the positive effects of MEK/ERK inhibition might involve several mechanisms in the MCA and in brain microvasculature associated with the cerebral ischemia.

Finally, to determine whether inhibition of the prosurvival MEK-ERK pathway is sufficient to induce cell death in sympathetic neurons we studied the effect of U0126 on cell viability over 72 hours (Figure

After initially observing that the MEK-ERK pathway negatively regulates 
In sympathetic neurons both the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 and the MEK5-ERK5 signalling pathways are stimulated in response to NGF and are activated downstream of Ras [
Finally, we showed that inhibition of the prosurvival MEK-ERK pathway by treatment with U0126 was sufficient to induce some neuronal death in the presence of NGF.
Raf-1 is associated ubiquitously in the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway.
Raf phosphorylates MEK1/2, which in turn phosphorylates and activates ERK1/2 and then leads to activation of transcription factors [
This confirms that specific inhibition of the ras/raf/MEK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway in the cerebrovascular system is associated with the receptor protein expression.
Moreover, treatment with an inhibitor of MEK-ERK1/2 signalling during an early time window from 6 to 24 h after SAH was sufficient to completely prevent delayed vasoconstrictor receptor upregulation and improve neurological outcome several days after the SAH.
Our findings suggest a series of events where 1) the acute CBF drop triggers early MEK-ERK1/2 activation, which 2) triggers the transcriptional upregulation of vasoconstrictor receptors in cerebral arteries during the following days, where 3) the resulting enhanced cerebrovascular contractility contribute to delayed cerebral ischemia.
We hypothesise that the drop in blood flow and wall tension experienced by cerebral arteries in acute SAH is a key triggering event, which via early MEK-ERK1/2 activation in cerebral arteries initiates the process of delayed cerebrovascular vasoconstrictor receptor upregulation contributing to delayed cerebral ischemia.
The aim of the present study is to investigate whether the duration of the acute CBF drop during SAH determines the degree of early MEK-ERK1/2 signalling in cerebral arteries, delayed vasoconstrictor receptor upregulation and delayed cerebral ischemia.
Also, we aimed to investigate whether inhibition of the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway in an early time-window after SAH would prevent delayed vasoconstrictor receptor upregulation and neurological deficits.
We show that a prolonged acute CBF drop triggers early MEK-ERK1/2 activation in cerebral arteries that again is a key triggering event for delayed vasoconstrictor receptor upregulation and cerebral ischemia.
Activation of the MEK-ERK1/2 signalling pathway has been suggested to trigger upregulation of contractile receptors in cerebral arteries after SAH [
To assess whether inhibition of the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway during the early time-window post-SAH would also improve neurological outcome, we evaluated the neurological function of the rats by means of a rotating pole test.
Moreover, we show for the first time that treatment with an inhibitor of MEK-ERK1/2 signalling only during an early time window from 6 to 24 h after the SAH is sufficient to completely prevent delayed vasoconstrictor receptor upregulation and improve neurological outcome several days after the SAH.
These findings suggest a series of events where 1) the drop in blood flow and wall tension experienced by the cerebral arteries during SAH triggers early activation of the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway, which 2) triggers increased expression and contractile function of vasoconstrictor receptors in cerebral arteries during the following days, where 3) the resulting enhanced cerebrovascular contractility contribute to development of delayed cerebral ischemia evident as CBF reduction, neurological deficits and mortality.
The MEK-ERK1/2 signalling pathway has earlier been demonstrated to be involved in the upregulation of cerebrovascular ET
In conclusion, our findings suggest that delayed upregulation of vasoconstrictor receptors in cerebral arteries as well as delayed CBF reduction and neurological deficits several days after an SAH is triggered by the acute CBF drop during the SAH followed by early MEK-ERK1/2 signalling in the cerebral arteries.

Our results demonstrate that inhibition of the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade using RAS, RAF, MEK, ERK or p38-MAPK inhibitors blocked the propofol-induced c-Fos and Egr-1 expression, thus suggesting the possible involvement of MAPK/ERK pathway in propofol-induced immediate early gene expression.
However, cetuximab exposure induced the EGFR, MEK, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation by itself.
We also show that RASSF1C over-expression induces phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in lung cancer cells, and inhibition of the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway suppresses the expression of PIWIL1 gene expression, suggesting that RASSF1C may exert its activities on some target genes such as PIWIL1 through the activation of the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway.
(A) Treatment of NCI-H1299 with the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor CI1040 resulted in down-regulating PIWIL1 mRNA levels.

Raf, in turn, phosphorylates the mitogen extracellular kinase, MEK, the second kinase in the cascade, which finally phosphorylates the MAP kinase (extracellular signal-related kinase, ERK).

In addition, H1299L858R, which is supposed to be more sensitive to gefitinib than H1299EGFR-WT, was effectively inhibited by gefitinib administration at the downstream part of the signaling pathway (MEK and ERK) compared with H1299EGFR-WT, but, surprisingly, not at the upstream part of the pathway (EGFR and Shc).
Detailed computational analyses revealed that Mig6 amplifies gefitinib sensitivity at the steps of MEK phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and ERK phosphorylation/dephosphorylation.
Antibodies against anti-phospho-EGFR (PY1068), doubly phosphorylated p44/42 ERK (Thr202/Tyr204), ERK, phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser217/221), MEK, Mig6 and actin were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA).
Although the sensitivity to inhibition of phosphorylation by gefitinib was different in the downstream proteins (MEK and ERK) between H1299EGFR-WT and H1299L858R cells, the difference was small in the upstream proteins (EGFR and Shc).
EGF activates the small GTPase Ras, which activates ERK downstream of the Raf and MEK kinases.
Therefore, we measured the dynamic and dose response of RasGTP with and without the MEK inhibitor U0126, and found that blocking ERK activation increased RasGTP levels, confirming the presence of strong negative feedback (Figure 
Firstly, we simulated steady state responses of the MAPK pathway after perturbing only five out of six modules (adapter, initiator, MAP3K, MAP2K and MAPK) modules by knocking down Shc, Ras, Raf, MEK and ERK one at a time.

Combination treatment of LY294002 [the inhibitor of PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/Akt (protein kinase B or PKB) pathway] or PD98509 {the inhibitor of MEK [MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)/ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) kinase] pathway} with PF-3758309 (the PAK4 inhibitor) resulted in increased CDDP efficacy compared with LY294002 or PD98509 alone.
Inhibition of PAK4 by PF-3758309 could significantly suppress MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signalling in CDDP-resistant cells.
Furthermore, inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway while not MEK/ERK pathway could inhibit PAK4 activity in these cells.
Our results demonstrate that PAK4 confers CDDP resistance in gastric cancer cells via the activation of MEK/ERK (MAPK or mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) and PI3K/Akt (phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B or PKB) pathways.
To explore the mechanism underlying PAK4-induced CDDP resistance in gastric cancer cells, the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor LY294002 and the MEK/ERK inhibitor PD98509 were used.
As confirmed above, inhibition of PAK4 activity led to suppression of both MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways.
Inhibition of the ERK activity by mitogen-activated extracellular signal regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitors (UO126 and PD98059) enhanced the cytotoxic activity of AZD1480.
One observation made here was that expression of p15Ink4b results in phosphorylation of MEK and ERK1/2, a signaling cascade shown previously to be essential for erythropoiesis.
The molecular mechanism responsible for these effects was the interaction of MR-1 with MEK, which blocked the MEK/ERK signaling pathway by dephosphorylating MEK.
The knockdown of MR-1 inhibited proliferation and induced blast cell differentiation forward MK lineage through activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway induced by the upregulation of MEK phosphorylation.
Although p38, JUK and MEK/ERK signaling cascades participated in the differentiation of CML,
To confirm whether MK differentiation was induced through the MEK/ERK pathway in MR-1-silencing cells, the MEK inhibitor U0126
It is well known that the activation of MEK/ERK is essential for the MK differentiation of K562 cells induced by PMA.
MR-1 silencing triggers MK differentiation and inhibits proliferation by sustained activation of the MEK/ERK pathway, which was a result of the downregulation of MEK phosphorylation mediated by MR-1.
The MEK/ERK signal involved in MK differentiation by MR-1-mediated MEK dephosphorylation.
The Ras/Raf/MEK/extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) (Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)) signal transduction pathway is a crucial mediator of many fundamental biological processes, including cellular proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and migration.
The Ras/MAPK pathway is the best characterised of the mammalian MAPK signal transduction networks, consisting of the Ras proteins, a family of small G-coupled molecules, the Raf kinases (MAP3K), the MAP2K kinases (MEK1 and MEK2) and the pathway distil kinases ERK1 and ERK2.
The Raf family of serine/threonine kinases (A-, B- and c-Raf (Raf-1)) lie at the apex of the MEK/ERK pathway.
Importantly, the activity of a number of these proteins is modulated by MEK/ERK signalling.
MEK1 and MEK2 are homologous dual specificity kinases that share ERK as their only known catalytic substrate,
For example, the poor correlation between MEK inhibitor susceptibility Ras genotypes and p-ERK expression is well documented.
The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway has an established role in the various neoplastic phenotypes observed in many malignancies.
In fact, the constitutively active form of MEK1 or RAS, two specific upstream MAPK/ERK activators, even repressed its activity, although ERK activation seemed important for C7ORF41 function in megakaryocyte differentiation (
The ERKs are activated by a number of different factors, including c-Src, the G-protein-linked kinase Raf, and MEK (
Abbreviations: ERK=extracellular-regulated kinase; MEK=mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; PlGF=placental growth factor.
Sorafenib is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor that targets the Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathway and receptor tyrosine kinases involved in tumour cell proliferation and angiogenesis (
Increased signalling through the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, as a result of autocrine stimulation by basic fibroblast growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor, is implicated in melanocytic tumorigenesis (tumour growth, invasion and metastasis) (
Activation of mitogen/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase kinase 5/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-5 (MEK5/ERK5) growth signalling is coupled to increased cell proliferation in prostate cancer (PCa).
In this study we have investigated linkages between the MEK5/ERK5 pathway and DNA replication licensing during prostate carcinogenesis.
The effects of increased MEK5/ERK5 signalling on the expression of replication licensing factors Mcm2 and geminin and the proliferation marker Ki67 were studied in an ecdysone-inducible system expressing a constitutively activated mutant of MEK5 in EcR293 cells and in stable ERK5 over-expressing PC3 clones.
The mitogen/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase kinase 5/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-5 (MEK5/ERK5) pathway has been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation.
Here we have investigated the regulation of growth control in PCa by investigating linkages between MEK5/ERK5 growth signalling and the downstream DNA replication (or origin) licensing pathway (RLP).
An ecdysone-inducible system expressing a constitutively activated mutant of MEK5 in EcR293 cells was used to determine the effects of increased MEK5/ERK5 signalling on the DNA RLP.
To investigate potential linkages between the MEK5/ERK5 signalling pathway and the downstream DNA replication (or origin) licensing pathway (RLP), we first used an ecdysone-inducible system to express a constitutively activated mutant of MEK5 (MEK5D) in EcR293 cells (
To investigate coupling of MEK5/ERK5 signalling to the RLP 
We sought to identify the relationship between the MEK5/ERK5 growth signalling pathway and the RLFs Mcm2 and geminin, as well as the standard proliferation marker Ki67. 
Moreover, our data show that induction of MEK5/ERK5 signalling is linked to activation of the DNA replication licensing pathway in PCa, which is associated with marked changes in cell cycle kinetics of these tumours indicative of a shift to increased growth potential.
Thus anti-cancer therapy directed at both MEK5/ERK5 signalling and the DNA replication licensing machinery offers an attractive approach for multitargeted therapy in PCa.
Recently, the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway has been found to play an important role in melanocytic neoplasia (
In summary, this study provided data of cell proliferation experiments employing antisense ODNs and protein kinase inhibitors, which indicate that the resistance of T24 cells to the genistein growth-inhibitory effect is predominantly due to the activation of oncogenic H-ras that transduces the growth signal through the MEK/ERK pathway and interferes with the JNK signalling pathway.
The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway is involved in the balance between melanocyte proliferation and differentiation.
Whereas mutant BRAF and NRAS are responsible for the activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway in most cutaneous melanoma, mutations in these genes are usually absent in UM.
We set out to explore the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and used mitogen-activated protein kinase profiling and tyrosine kinase arrays.
However, low Src levels and reduced ERK1/2 activation in metastatic cell lines suggest that proliferation in metastases can become independent of Src and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signalling.
The ras proto-oncogene can activate downstream TK substrates (e.g., MAPK, MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)) that influence cell proliferation, survival and apoptosis and has been implicated in breast cancer (
A function for the rebound pERK signalling in therapy escape was demonstrated by the ability of combined BRAF/MEK inhibition to enhance the levels of apoptosis and abrogate the onset of resistance.
Having demonstrated that pERK signalling recovered after PLX4720 treatment, we next determined whether dual BRAF/MEK inhibition led to enhanced cytotoxicity.
We showed that apoptosis enhancement by MnSOD siRNA was mediated through the activation of an MEK1-ERK1/2 signalling pathway.
The MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 suppressed ERK1/2 activation and effectively protected the MnSOD siRNA-transfected cells from the drug-induced apoptosis.
Both growth factors utilise the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway.
B-Raf appears to be the main activator of the MEK-ERK pathway (
Yet another level of specificity could be achieved through the differential activation of MEK and ERK isoforms.
Both MEK and ERK feature two isoforms in mammalian cells.
This is proven by the phenotype of MEK and ERK knockout mice.
Another example is MP-1, a small scaffold that ties MEK and ERK together.
MP-1 also binds to p14, an endosomal protein, which targets the MEK/ERK/MP-1 signalling complex to late endosomes.
Curiously, mitochondrial Raf-1 did not activate the MEK-ERK pathway, but rather phosphorylated and inactivated BAD, a proapoptotic protein (
Using the Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathway as paradigm, we have highlighted some of these mechanisms including differential protein interactions, subcellular compartmentalisation, different modes of activation, and differential targeting of downstream effectors.
This process involves activation of the cytoplasmic serine-threonine kinase Raf-1, which phosphorylates and activates mitogen activated kinase kinase mitogenic extracellular kinase (MEK), which in turn phosphorylates and activates ERK1/2 (p44/p42) on tyrosine and threonine residues.
U0126 (1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(2-aminophenylthio) butadiene) is a noncompetitive inhibitor of MEK with no other effects in the ERK cascade (
We have chosen to develop an endpoint for drugs, which act on the Raf-1-MEK-ERK signal transduction pathway.
Our results suggest that choline could be used as a non-invasive PET or MRS imaging probe to monitor the effects of geldanamycin analogues, which target the tyrosine kinase receptor-Ras-Raf-1-MEK-ERK cascade.
To confirm that the MEK/ERK and p38 kinase pathways are involved in TIMP-1 cell proliferation, ERK and p38 kinase activity assays were done on treated and untreated cells.
The Raf-MEK-ERK cascade is one of the major signalling pathways promoting cell survival (
The signalling pathways employing the mitogen-activated ERK-activating kinase (MEK) and the extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) are critical in growth factors signalling.
Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor targeting tumour angiogenesis and Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, is the only drug approved for patients with advanced HCC (
Recent work by our laboratory has demonstrated the importance of the MEK5/ERK5 (mitogen/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 5) cascade in invasive CaP (
In addition, the role of ERK5 in control of cell cycle progression is complicated by the relative role of MEK5-mediated ERK5 phosphorylation and nuclear localisation.
Effects of sorafenib are known to be transduced by the Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathway (
Besides the commonly known effects of cisplatin inducing DNA damage, growing evidence exists that MEK/ERK pathway is a regulator of cisplatin-induced apoptosis (
Next, lysates from untreated and drug-treated tumour cells were analysed by Western blot for the expression of MEK1/2 and its substrate ERK1/2.
The same blots were stripped and analysed with antibodies recognising dually phosphorylated MEK (pMEK) 1/2 or dually phosphorylated ERK (pERK) 1/2 to verify the active fraction of each protein in our experiments.
Results illustrated that, despite high expression, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 proteins were mainly unphosphorylated in untreated NCCIT cells (
CDDP-induced activation of the MEK/ERK pathway in NCCIT cells.
To study whether ERK activation is required for CDDP-induced apoptosis in NCCIT cells, two chemical MEK1/2 inhibitors, U0126 and PD98059, were used.
To prove whether activation of the MEK/ERK pathway seen in the p53-mutated TGCT cell line NCCIT is also required for the CDDP-induced apoptosis in human neoplastic germ cells with wt-p53, NTERA cells were treated with CDDP.
MEK1 and MEK2 are protein kinases that when activated (phosphorylated) are believed to dually phosphorylate only ERK1 and ERK2, thereby increasing the enzymatic activity of ERKs approximately 1000-fold over the activity found with the basal or monophosphorylated forms (
Immunoblots supported these data and demonstrated that both MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 proteins were strongly expressed but were mainly unphosphorylated and thereby inactive in untreated tumour cells.
Interestingly, CDDP treatment resulted in high and sustained activation of MEK, particularly MEK1, and ERK, especially ERK2, which was strongly correlated to the apoptosis of tumour cells.
Experiments revealed that the MEK inhibitors not only downregulated the level of ERK phosphorylation but also reduced the apoptotic rate of CDDP-treated NCCIT cells, as previously reported for the cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa (
The core components of the MAPK signalling cascades are three sequential kinases, including MAP kinase (MAPK, or extracellular signal-regulated kinase, ERK), MAPK kinase (MAPKK, or MAPK/ERK kinase, MEK), and MAPKK kinase (MAPKKK, or MEK kinase, MEKK).
The active Raf will phosphorylate MEK and then the phosphorylated MEK will phosphorylate ERK1/2(MAPK).
The MAPK pathway represents a cascade of phosphorylation events including three pivotal kinases, namely Raf, MEK (MAP kinase kinase) and ERK (MAP kinase).
The Ras/Raf/MEK/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (MEK is the MAPK or extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) kinase) cascade mediates cellular response to growth signals (
To further examine the involvement of ERK1/2 in FAK signalling during A549 cell migration and invasion, we took advantage of the availability of PD98059, an inhibitor of the ERK1/2 upstream kinase, MEK1/2.
The involvement of FAK-stimulated ERK1/2 signalling in fibronectin-induced A549 lung cancer cell migration and invasion was supported by our observation that these processes are inhibited in cells treated with PD98059, an inhibitor of the ERK1/2 upstream kinase, MEK.
Focusing on the more promising candidate proteins, phospho-mitogen-regulated kinase 1 (p-MEK1), phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (p-ERK1/2) and those total proteins; we measured (
Two of these proteins, p-ERK1/2 and p-MEK1, are shown in 
To examine the potential source of the activated ERK and MEK in serum, we performed immunohistochemical staining for these phosphoproteins in resected PaCa tissues.
The 23 patients were divided into two groups based on positive or negative staining in PaCa cells, 16 (69.6%) of 23 cases were p-ERK-positive staining, and 19 (82.6%) cases were p-MEK-positive staining.
To confirm the results obtained from the training set, we measured and analysed both ERK and MEK serum levels with an increased sample size in validation set 1.
Similar results were obtained, that both p-ERK1/2 and p-MEK1 levels were significantly increased in sera from PaCa patients compared with that of HVs for validation set 1 (p-ERK1/2; 
The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.94 for p-ERK1/2, and concerning with other phosphoproteins, the AUCs were 0.79 for p-MEK1, 0.81 for p-p90RSK, 0.86 for p-CREB and 0.83 for p-Akt in the training set.
The activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the various downstream targets, such as Ras, Raf, MEK and ERK, are deeply implicated in the pathogenesis of PaCa with malignant transformation and enhanced tumour aggressiveness.
Immunohistochemistry of PaCa tissues showed that two target phosphoproteins, p-ERK and p-MEK, were simultaneously well expressed during the early stage neoplasms, even in the cancer cells of non-invasive or minimally invasive ductal carcinoma, as well as in the advanced stage patients with PaCa.
Furthermore, both p-ERK and p-MEK levels in sera of PaCa patients were in good correlation with the positive staining of their PaCa tissues.
Both the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways are activated downstream of the chronic myeloid leukaemia BCR-ABL fusion protein.
The activation results in proliferation and survival through the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK or PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathways, respectively (
Inhibitors of PI3K, MEK/ERK, mTOR, as well as siRNAs to AKT1 and AKT2 enhance 
To test whether the basal ERK1/2 activity was providing an escape mechanism from inhibition by PKI166, cells were treated with a combination of PKI166 and UO126, an inhibitor of MEK (
The MEK inhibitors PD98059 and UO126 abolish stimulation by IGF-1 of ERK phosphoryation but have no influence on the phosphorylation of Akt (first and third panel).
Suppression of MAP kinase (MEK-ERK) signalling has been observed in NB cells with acquired resistance to DOX (
The ERK/MAPK is activated by dual phosphorylation on a threonine and a tyrosine residue, achieved by the dual-specificity kinase MAP kinase kinase (MEK) (
The report that RAS/MEK/ERK pathway activates RPS6 independently of mTOR through p90 ribosomal S6 kinase supports this postulate (
Tyr1173 is a major binding site for the adapter protein SHC and mediates activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway (
Although pre-clinical studies indicate that blocking oncogenic BRAF signalling provides a promising strategy for MM treatment, current clinical trials are yet to demonstrate whether pharmacological targeting of the BRAF/MEK/ERK pathway represents an effective treatment for melanoma as a monotherapy.
Outwith the cancer context, an important role for the Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK signalling axis in regulating NFAT transcriptional activity has been established in immune cells and in myocytes.
In T cells, dominant negative BRAF or MEK inhibition completely abolished activated TCR-driven ERK activation, IL-2 promoter activation and activation of NFAT1 and 2 indicating the importance of MAPK/NFAT signalling in immune cell biology (
The involvement of MEK/ERK activation raises the possibility that other upstream signals activating MEK/ERK may increase NFAT activity.
The Raf/MEK/ERK cascade is the longest-studied and probably the best-described Ras effector pathway.
One outstanding feature of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in mammals is redundancy.
Mammals have three Raf isoforms (A-Raf, B-Raf and Raf-1, also known as C-Raf), two MEK and two ERK isoforms.
All three Rafs can bind to Ras and phosphorylate MEK, although B-Raf is much more efficient than the other two and is necessary for ERK activation 
Consistent with its prominent role as a MEK kinase, B-Raf is the component of the ERK pathway most often mutated in human tumours, with a particularly high frequency (43%) in human melanoma.
The most frequent B-Raf mutation, V600E, results in constitutive catalytic activity and MEK/ERK activation.
These compounds, some of which are already being used in the clinic, efficiently inhibit MEK/ERK activation in cells harbouring the B-Raf V600E mutation (
The role of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in epidermal proliferation has been clearly established in animal models, in which inducible activation of Raf or MEK in the epidermis results in massive cutaneous hyperplasia and reduced differentiation (
Downstream of Ras, Raf-1 is involved in at least two pathways: the canonical Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, where Raf-1 acts as an activator, likely in the context of a Ras-induced heterodimer with B-Raf; and the Rok-
This phase I study investigates the combination of two oral small molecule signal transduction inhibitors each targeting different pathways, namely the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and VEGF pathway (sorafenib) and the phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway (sirolimus).

RKIP is a ubiquitously expressed phospholipid-binding protein that functions as an endogenous inhibitor of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signalling cascade (
The Raf protein kinase activates the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway that initiates cell proliferation.
Since BRAF mutations can lead to a constitutive activation of the protein kinase activity and thus downstream activation of MEK and the ERK1/2 kinases with induction of proliferation, BRAF inhibitors have been shown to be effective with tumour responses in about 48% of V600E-mutated melanoma patients (
MEK5/ERK5 1384
The aim of this study was to investigate whether MAD2 played a role in cisplatin-induced apoptosis in TGCT cells and whether MEK/ERK pathway was involved in this process.
Using 10 TGCT cell lines, we found that increased MAD2 expression was correlated with sensitivity to cisplatin and activation of the MEK/ERK pathway.
Suppression of MEK/ERK pathway in cells with high levels of MAD2 conferred resistance to cisplatin.
Inactivation of MAD2, on the other hand, led to suppression of the MEK/ERK pathway and decreased sensitivity to cisplatin-induced apoptosis.
As discussed previously, activation of MEK/ERK pathway is critical for cisplatin-induced apoptosis (
GH cells were chosen because of their relatively high levels of MAD2 and p-MEK1/2, p-ERK1/2 and p-Elk-1 proteins in response to cisplatin.
In addition, the positive association between MAD2 expression and cisplatin-induced MEK/ERK pathway activation indicates that the MEK/ERK signalling pathway may play an important role in the MAD2-mediated cisplatin sensitivity.
The importance of MEK/ERK pathway in regulating apoptosis after cisplatin treatment has been suggested.
The loss of tumour phospho-extracellular responsive kinase (pERK) positivity is the major treatment biomarker for mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular responsive kinase (MEK) inhibitors.
Here, we demonstrate that there is a poor correlation between pERK inhibition and the anti-proliferative effects of MEK inhibitors in melanoma cells.
Constitutive activity of BRAF is known to be critical for the proliferation and survival of melanoma cells through the activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway (
Here, we demonstrate that there is little parallel between the inhibition of pERK and the anti-proliferative activity of two MEK inhibitors in a panel of seven melanoma cell lines.
New targeted agents directed against the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway show promising activity in early clinical development and particular interest is focused on selective inhibitors of mutant BRAF, which is present in one half of the cases of metastatic melanoma.
Preclinical studies have demonstrated a close interconnection of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signalling pathways, with complex inter-related feedback loops.
There is increasing evidence that combination therapies targeting the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and the PI3K-AKT-mTOR may be more effective than single-agent therapies.
Preclinical studies have also shown a synergism between BRAF and MEK inhibitors, with significantly increased apoptosis and prolonged phospho-ERK inhibition compared with BRAF inhibition alone (
Moreover, there is compelling evidence to combine chemotherapy with other inhibitors of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways.
Recently, our laboratory showed the importance of the MEK5/ERK5 (mitogen/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 5) cascade in PCa (
Cells are maintained and used as described previously: PC3, PC3-derived ERK5 overexpressing (PC3-ERK5) cells and inducible HEK293 cells expressing MEK5D (a constitutively active mutant of MEK5) (
To further assess the potential mitogenic effects of ERK5 signalling in prostate carcinogenesis, the effects of suppressed endogenous ERK5 expression by siRNA or function by the MEK inhibitor PD184352 were investigated in a proliferation assay using PC3 parental cells.
Recent data have been accumulating to support a key role of MEK5/ERK5 signalling in carcinogenesis.
Although MEK5/ERK5 signalling clearly promotes cell cycle promotion in certain context (
Given that MEK/ERK molecules are downstream effectors of ARMS, we thus examined the role of MEK/ERK signalling in ARMS-mediated migration and invasion.
Depletion of ARMS deteriorates migratory and invasive abilities in melanoma cells via MEK/ERK signalling.
Our study shows that the clinical activities of sorafenib are mediated not only through VEGFR and PDGFR, and their principal downstream signalling pathways (Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT) but also through inhibition of non-angiogenic pathways that include inhibition of apoptosis, cell cycle proteins, and survivin, which are not previously reported.
The multikinase inhibitor (TKI) sorafenib (Nexavar; Bayer HealthCare, Milan, Italy), which targets the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway as well as vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) 1, 2 and 3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-b, c-Kit, Fit-3 and RET, has shown dual anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic activity (

The combination of TAE684 and a MEK inhibitor-induced marked apoptosis accompanied by inhibition of STAT3 and ERK pathways in H2228 cells.
We therefore next examined the effects of the combination of TAE684 and AZD6244, a specific inhibitor of the ERK kinase MEK, on intracellular signalling and apoptosis in H2228 cells.
The Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway is frequently deregulated in cancer and a number of inhibitors that target this pathway are currently in clinical development.
To support this strategy, it has been widely observed that a number of chemotherapeutics stimulate the activation of several intracellular signalling cascades including Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK.
Members of the Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, in particular KRAS and BRAF, are frequently deregulated in several cancers including melanoma, colorectal (CRC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic (
Three major subfamilies of the MAPK pathways have been identified; JNK/SAPK's, p38 MAPK and MEK/ERK.
Once activated, ERK, along with RAF and MEK, migrate to the nucleus where they activate cyclin D1 and downregulate p27 thus driving cell proliferation (
A number of studies have previously described that combining inhibitors of the Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK cascade with the microtubule stabilising agent docetaxel (or paclitaxel) results in an enhanced anti-tumourigenic phenotype (
The scheduling sequence dependency observed, when mitotic agents and MEK inhibitors are combined, could be due to inhibition of the ERK1/2 pathway resulting in a G1 arrest.
The role of Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK cascade in key cellular events such as the cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA damage, highlights the potential of combining MEK inhibitors with chemotherapeutics belonging to several functional classes.
Both PD0325901 and AZD6244 inhibited ERK phosphorylation, and with MEK/PI3K inhibitor combinations inhibition of S6 phosphorylation was increased.
The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signalling pathway is constitutively activated in several cancers, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation, resistance to apoptosis and association with a more aggressive neoplastic phenotype (
Activation of the classic MAPK cascade (RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK) is a common event in colorectal and lung cancer.

It has been established that sorafenib blocks the Raf-MEK pathway and inhibits ERK activation.
To mimic sorafenib-mediated inhibition of ERK, PD98059, a potent and selective inhibitor of MEK/ERK kinase, was used in combination with tetrandrine to treat BEL7402 and HCT116 cells (
Notwithstanding the role of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in biliary tract cancers, there was no correlation between pretreatment tumour cell pERK expression levels and outcome.
In addition, pazopanib increased pERK1/2 phosphorylation in BC cells, and a specific MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059, reduced the pazopanib-induced autophagy.
ADC may provide a useful non-invasive pharmacodynamic biomarker for early clinical assessment of response to selumetinib and other MEK-ERK1/2 signalling-targeted therapies.
The RAS-BRAF-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway is an important signalling cascade in cancer that has attracted much attention as a key target for rational anti-cancer treatment.
Treatment with BRAF-MEK-ERK1/2 signalling inhibitors, such as selumetinib, causes marked anti-tumour effects in many pre-clinical models.
MEK1/2 signalling inhibition following selumetinib treatment in WM266.4 and Colo205 human tumour xenografts was assessed by western blotting for levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (P-ERK1/2).
DW-MRI can be readily incorporated into non-invasive imaging protocols forming part of clinical trials, thus allowing our findings to be translated to patient studies where the value of tumour ADC as a non-invasive biomarker of response to BRAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signalling inhibitors can be assessed.
Hereby, activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and TGF-
It has been reported that post-infarction HGF gene therapy resulted in substantial cardiomyocte hypertrophy at the edges of the infarcted tissue, accompanied by the overexpression of the HGF receptor (c-Met), which is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase through which HGF activates the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, thereby contributing to myocardial hypertrophy (

These included mouse IgG for ATM (2C1) (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA), Cdc2 (17), Chk1 (G-4), Chk2 (B-4), PARP (Ab-2) (EMD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), phospho-ERK1/2 (E-4); rabbit IgG for ATM (Ab-3) (EMD Biosciences), Cdc2 (C-19), Chk1 (FL-476), Chk2 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA) MEK1/2 (12-B), Rac1 (C-14); and goat IgG for Actin (I-19), ATR (N-19), phospho-Cdc2 (Tyr15), ERK1/2 (C-14-G), and phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser118/Ser122).
With Rac1-specific siRNA, the effect of Rac1 expression on IR-induced phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 was also examined.
Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrate that inhibition of ERK1/2 by MEK1/2 specific inhibitors or decreased ERK1/2 expression by transfection of cells with ERK1/2 siRNA abrogated the IR-induced ATR activation in MCF-7 cells but had little effect on ATM activation [
The Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway has been linked to metastasis [
Since Six1 leads to an increase in ERK activation, we examined whether inhibition of MEK/ERK signaling, using the MEK1/2 kinase inhibitor U0126, decreases the ability of Six1 to enhance TICs.
The mechanism by which Six1 activates MEK/ERK signaling is still unknown.

Ras is a major activator of MEK/ERK signaling [
To examine the role of Ras in mediating the NO activation of the MEK/ERK/Ets-1 signaling pathway, MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with EGF or 0.5 mM DETANO with or without the Ras inhibitor FTS.
This effect of NO is mediated by Ras-SNO modification and subsequent MEK/ERK signaling to phosphorylate Ets-1 (thr 38).

In most cases connections between RMGs were largely mediated through a centralised component (shown in black) comprising 2808 genes (36 belonging to RMGs 8 to 42) and 3050 interactions, the majority of which emanated from a small number of non-metagene hubs (BRAF, RAF1, DDB1, IMMT, DLG4, TRAF6 and HCLS1).

('MYC', 'MAX', 'increases')
These matrices have been selected from the Transfac database and include MYC, MAX, ARNT, MYOD, USF, TAL1/E47 (see [35] for a review on E-box transcription factors).
The interaction between MAX and MYC is well documented (e.g., [
Our previous studies confirmed that the MYC-MAX binding site at -260/-246 was non-specific [
MXD3 is a basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine-zipper (bHLHZ) transcription factor that is part of the MYC/MAX/MXD transcriptional network [
C-MYC contains a basic, helix-loop-helix leucine-zipper motif (bHLH-LZ) and binds to E-box sequences (CACGTG) as a heterodimer with MAX, another bHLH-LZ protein [
We suggest that the transcription factors SMAD3/4, GNB2L1/RACK1, MYC, MAX and JUN, whose functions have been extensively studied in tumours but only marginally in muscle, appear instead to play important roles in regulating muscle response to atrophy.
In particular, MYC and MAX genes are found by both analysis, whereas SMAD3/4 proteins seem to be replaced by JUN and GNB2L1/RACK1 in the short-term signature.
The transcription factors MYC and MAX represent hub proteins also in the specific network that describes the molecular interactions involved in the early steps of muscle atrophy and their central role in the general biological processes related to atrophy is therefore reinforced.
The high proportion of the genes are likely regulated by the E2F-family of transcription factors and/or c-MYC/MAX transcription factors suggesting common regulatory mechanisms may lead in to the phenotypic difference of EGFR TKI-sensitive and -resistant cells.
Interestingly, we identified a motif similar to the binding site of MYC-MAX (see Figure 
In the first analysis the MYCMAX binding site was the most significant both with respect to E- and P-scores (Additional file 
Communities 4, 5, 11, 15 and 26 include transcription factors involved in cell cycle control such as CREB1, c-MYC-MAX complex, ELK1, E2F1, ER-alpha, FREAC7, CREBP1, RREB1 and MAZR.
For example, matrices for MYC_Q2, EBOX_Q6, and MYCMAX_02 were combined.
Finally, we examined the specificity of MYC-MAX binding site at -260 to -246 of BRD7 minimal promoter.
MatInspector analysis revealed a MYC-MAX, an E2F6 and a Sp1/Myc-Max overlapping site in BRD7 minimal promoter, suggesting that transcription factor E2F6, c-Myc and Sp1 may be involved in regulating of BRD7 minimal promoter.

For example, the MYC::MAX complex appears to primarily target genes annotated to functions enriched in the female-specific sputum network (but not in the blood network) while SOX5 targets genes in the male-specific sputum network.
In contrast, the central core element of this large 5' enhancer corresponds to a common DNAse I footprint (121 cell types) which matches DNA fragments pulled by ChIP-Seq that targeted a variety of transcription factors, including RNA Pol II, c-MYC-MAX, EGR-1, ETS-1 and ELF-1.
Elevated expression of c-MYC has been demonstrated in oesophageal adenocarcinoma; however, the expression of other members of the MYC/MAX/MAD network has not been addressed.
The aims of this work were to characterise the expression of c-MYC, MAX and the MAD family in adenocarcinoma development and assess the effects of overexpression on cellular behaviour.
Overexpression of c-MYC and MAD proteins in SEG1 cells resulted in differential expression of MYC/MAX/MAD network members and reciprocal changes in proliferation.
In conclusion, the expression patterns of c-MYC, MAX and the MAD family were shown to be deregulated in the oesophageal cancer model.
c-MYC is an oncogenic transcription factor, which, as part of a heterodimeric complex with MAX, activates the expression of a diverse range of genes implicated in cellular processes such as cell growth, proliferation, loss of differentiation and apoptosis (
The MAD family of transcriptional repressors, including MAD1 and MXI1, also bind to MAX and are believed to antagonise the activity of MYC proteins by competing for MAX-binding and interaction with E-box sequences in target gene promoters, and by actively repressing transcription of MYC target genes (
Immunohistochemical staining was utilised to establish MYC/MAX/MAD network protein localisation in normal oesophageal and gastric epithelia, Barrett's metaplasia, dysplastic Barrett's epithelium and oesophageal adenocarcinoma (
The expression of other members of the MYC/MAX/MAD network was assessed in transfected cells.

('EPH', 'EPHR', 'binds')
Our group has previously shown that EPHRIN-A1 and SCINDERIN expression by tumor cells rendered them resistant to cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated lysis.
Whereas the prognostic value of EPHRIN-A1 expression in cancer has already been studied, the role of SCINDERIN presence remains to be established.
In the present work, we investigated the prognosis value of EPHRIN-A1 and SCINDERIN expression in head and neck carcinomas.
Tumor tissue sections of 83 patients with head and neck cancer were assessed by immunohistochemistry for the expression of EPHRIN-A1, SCINDERIN, HLA class I molecules and the presence of CD8
No significant prognosis value could be attributed to these factors independently, despite a tendency of association between EPHRIN-A1 and a worse clinical outcome.
EPH receptor tyrosine kinases and their EPHRIN ligands constitute a large cell communication system with the ability of generating bidirectional signaling: forward signals in EPH-receptor expressing cells and reverse signals in EPHRIN ligand-expressing cells [
We have previously reported that increased EPHRIN-A1 and SCINDERIN expression in tumor cells conferred resistance to CD8
83 patients with untreated and histologically diagnosed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were enrolled for EPHRIN-A1 and SCINDERIN expression analysis from January 2004 to December 2011.
Since we previously demonstrated that the expression of EPHRIN-A1 and SCINDERIN by tumor cells resulted in their resistance to the lysis by anti-tumoral CD8
Due to the low number of patients expressing SCINDERIN, we combined the EPHRIN-A1 and SCINDERIN expression to address whether the presence of either SCINDERIN or EPHRIN-A1, possible surrogate markers of resistance of tumor cells to lysis mediated by CD8
Our group showed that SCINDERIN and EPHRIN-A1 are directly responsible for conferring resistance to tumor cells from CD8
All of the aforementioned ECG formats are non proprietary and are therefore capable of achieving interoperability, whereas many ECG Management Systems (EMS) integrate closed proprietary formats into the EPHR.
