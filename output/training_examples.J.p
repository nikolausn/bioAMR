aS'The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (including the cascade of RAS, BRAF, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 proteins) has emerged as a major signaling cascade involved in the control of cell growth, proliferation, and migration in the majority of cancers.'
p1386
aS'This phase Ib/II study is evaluating the combination of LGX818, a potent, selective BRAF inhibitor, and MEK162, a selective MEK1/2 inhibitor, in patients with BRAF-mutant tumors (NCT01543698).'
p1387
aS'The MAPK-ERK pathway (including the cascade of NRAS, BRAF, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 proteins), a major signaling cascade involved in the control of cell growth, proliferation and migration, has been reported to play a major role in both the development and progression of melanoma (the increased activity of ERK1/2 proteins, which have been found to be constitutively activated in melanomas mostly as a consequence of mutations in upstream components of the pathway) and seems to be implicated in rapid melanoma cell growth, enhanced cell survival and resistance to apoptosis ['
p1388
aS'Several mechanisms of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibition have been identified including: acquisition of NRAS and MEK1 activating mutations, upregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (i.e., PDGFRB, ERBB2), PTEN loss, activation of the Ser/Thr MAPK kinases (COT), NF1 loss, BRAF truncations, BRAF amplification and possibly others.'
p1389
aS'In the coming years, it is reasonable to expect that another MEK inhibitor (MEK162), a third BRAF inhibitor (LGX818), another anti-PD-1 antibody (nivolumab) and an anti-PD-L1 antibody (MPDL3280A) will join the ranks of approved agents in melanoma.'
p1390
aS'There are various mechanisms of acquired (late) BRAFi resistance through MAPK pathway reactivation such as BRAF amplification and alternative splicing, RAS mutations, CDKN2A mutations, activating mutations in MEK1/2 and NF1 loss ['

p1607
aS'Thrombin is known to elevate the concentration of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) and to activate protein kinase C (PKC) in EC.'
p1608
aS'The kinase was tentatively identified as PKC epsilon because of its resistance to PMA down- modulation, independence of Ca2+ for activity, and reaction with a specific anti-PKC epsilon antibody in Western blots.'
p1609
aS'PMA effects were independent of either extra or intracellular Ca2+ as indicated by measurements of Ca2+ transients, and they were likely to be mediated through direct activation of PKC because inhibitors of the enzyme completely blocked the response to PMA.'
p1610
aS'The rise in intracellular pH might be the result of the translocation and activation of PKC produced by Ca2+ entry.'
p1611
aS'These findings indicate that the TRP-14-induced Ca2+ mobilization in the absence of PKC activation is insufficient to increase endothelial permeability.'
p1612
aS'In contrast, the increase in endothelial permeability after alpha-thrombin occurred in conjunction with Ca2+ mobilization as well as PKC activation.'
p1613
aS'The results suggest that combined cytosolic Ca2+ mobilization mediated by TRP-14 and PKC activation mediated by a TRP-14-independent pathway are dual signals responsible for the thrombin-induced increase in vascular endothelial permeability.'
p1614
aS'We have used immunocytofluorescence techniques to determine the subcellular distribution of the Ca2+, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C (PKC).'
p1615
aS'In contrast to PKC1-depleted cells, all of the conditional pkc1 mutants isolated were suppressed by the addition of CaCl2 to the medium, suggesting that the mutant enzymes could be activated by Ca2+.'
p1616
aS'We have explored the role of protein kinase C (PKC) in this process using an in vitro model system, in which cultures of primary mouse epidermal keratinocytes are induced to terminally differentiate by raising the Ca2+ concentration in the medium from 0.05 to 0.12 mM.'
p1617
aS'Activators of protein kinase C (PKC) (diacyl glycerol and phorbol ester) induced flattening and lamellipod activity and suppressed the Ca2+ spike, while cells injected with PKC inhibitors (an inhibitory peptide and low concentrations of heparin-like compounds) produced an enhanced Ca2+ spike on stimulation.'
p1618
aS'We conclude that InsP3 acting on Ca2+ stores and DAG acting via PKC regulate chemoattractant-induced changes in [Ca2+]i, which in turn control polarization and locomotion.'

aS'Engagement of the T cell receptor for antigen activates phospholipase C resulting in an increase in intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and activation of protein kinase C (PKC).'

aS"Our experiments explicitly show that: (a) crosslinkage of TCR with the CD2 antigen, and not independent crosslinking of TCR and of CD2 antigen or crosslinking of either protein with the CD4 or CD8 antigen induces significant proliferation independent of co-stimulatory signals (e.g., accessory cells, recombinant lymphokines, or tumor promoter), (b) F(ab')2 fragments of mAb directed at the TCR and F(ab')2 anti-CD2, crosslinked with F(ab')2 fragments of rabbit anti-mouse IgG, promote the proliferation of highly purified T cells, (c) a prompt and sustained increase in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration results from crosslinkage of TCR with the CD2 antigen, (d) T cell proliferation induced by this novel approach is curtailed by EGTA and by direct or competitive inhibitors of PKC, (e) crosslinkage of TCR with the CD2 antigen results in the transcriptional activation and translation of the gene for IL-2 and in the expression of IL-2 receptor alpha (CD25), (f) anti-CD25 mAbs inhibit T cell proliferation initiated by crosslinkage of TCR with the CD2 antigen, and recombinant IL-2 restores the proliferative response."

aS'Isolated Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts were subjected to 45-min ischemia (Isc) followed by 120-min reperfusion (R) with or without IPC, induced by 5-min Isc and 10-min R. In the CPC hearts, 5-min Ca2+ depletion and 10-min repletion (CPC) were given before 45-min Isc, with or without concurrent PKC inhibition (calphostin C, 200 nmol/L).'

aS'Mechanisms of Ca2+ sensitization of both myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation and force development by protein kinase C (PKC) were studied in permeabilized tonic smooth muscle obtained from the rabbit femoral artery.'
p1624
aS'We now report that PKC activators (phorbol esters, short chain synthetic diacylglycerols and a diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor) and GTP gamma S significantly increase both MLC phosphorylation and force development at constant [Ca2+].'
p1625
aS'These results indicate that PKC, like activation of GTP binding protein, increases Ca2+ sensitivity of both MLC phosphorylation and force production through inhibition of MLC phosphatase.'
p1626
aS'We measured extracellular changes of Ca2+ [delta Ca2+]o in Drosophila retina using Ca(2+)-selective microelectrodes in both the transient receptor potential (trp) mutant, in which the calcium permeability of the light-sensitive channels is greatly diminished and in the inactivation-but-no-afterpotential C (inaC) mutant which lacks photoreceptor-specific protein kinase C (PKC).'
p1627
aS'The enhanced Ca2+ signal was diminished in the double mutant inaC;trp indicating that the effect of the trp mutation overrides the enhancement observed in the absence of eye-PKC.'
p1628
aS'We suggest that the decrease in [Ca2+]o reflects light-induced Ca2+ influx into the photoreceptors and that the trp mutation blocks a large fraction of this Ca2+ influx, while the absence of eye specific PKC leads to enhancement of light-induced Ca2+ influx.'
p1629
aS'Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that TRP is a light activated Ca2+ channel and that the increased Ca2+ influx observed in the absence of PKC is mediated mainly via the TRP channel.'

aS'Of note, although it is shown that RhoA/ROCK cascade is the intermediate between PI3K to FAK, it is still possible that PI3K directly interacts with FAK and results in FAK activation, because the interaction of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K with FAK has been shown to trigger FAK phosphorylation ['
p2697
aS'The antibodies used in this study were anti-Arp3; C-myc, Bax, Bcl-xl, Cleaved Caspase3, FAK, Phos-FAK, Phos-PI3K, MMP2, MMP9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1), Paxillin, Phos-paxillin, Erk, Phos-Erk (Cell Signaling Technology), c-Src, Phos-c-Src (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Rac1 (Millipore).'
p2698
aS'(C and D) Colorectal cancer HT-29 (C) or CT-26 cells (D) were treated with YH-306, and whole-cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with antibodies against Arp3, Paxillin, PI3K, FAK, MMP9, MMP2, TIMP1 and Erk.'
p2699
aS'To answer this question, FAK KO and WT mice were subjected to either the IP protocol or a sham experimental protocol, and ventricular lysates were harvested and analyzed for expression of tyrosine phosphorylated PI3K p85 as a surrogate for PI3K activation'
p2700
aS'Representative Western blots showing (A) pPI3K p85; (B) pAkt expression in lysates from hearts of WT and FAK KO mice subjected to either the IP protocol or a sham procedure; (C) normalized integrated density data for cardiac pPI3K p85 expression; and (D) pAkt expression.'
p2701
aS'PI3K/AKT has been reported to be a key signal pathway promoting cell proliferation and EMT and can be modulated by FAK ['
p2702
aS'In summary, ENO1 is overexpressed in NSCLC, promoting cell glycolysis, proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumorigenesis by activating the FAK-mediated PI3K/AKT pathway and further modulating their downstream signal molecules.'
p2703
aS'Thus, concomitant expression of cell cycle genes, PI3K, MAPK and FAK2 together with interacting partners ERBB2, GRB2 and integrin v-beta (ITB5) in the HIV-infected T-cells is central to the endothelial cell proliferation which is directly relevant to various biological processes involved in angiogenesis.'
p2704
aS'GC: Gastric cancer; EMT: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition; PI3K: Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; FAK: Focal adhesion kinase; shRNA: Short hairpin RNA; MMP: Matrix metalloproteinase; ECM: Extracellular matrix; 5-FU: 5- fluorouracil; MTT: Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium; PBS: Phosphate-buffered saline; PI: Propidium iodide.'

aS'Soluble CD147 activated ERK, FAK, and PI3K/Akt pathways, leading to the up-regulation of MMP-2.'
p2706
aS'The extracellular domain of soluble CD147 enhances the secretion of MMP-2 from HCC cells, requiring the cooperation of membrane CD147 and activation of ERK, FAK, and PI3K/Akt signaling.'
p2707
aS'Here we found extracellular domain of soluble CD147 enhances the secretion of MMP-2 from HCC cells, requiring the cooperation of membrane CD147 and activation of ERK, FAK, and PI3K/Akt signaling.'
p2708
aS'Activated FAK has also been shown to support PI3Kp85 phosphorylation following integrin clustering, but the mechanism(s) is not fully understood ['
p2709
aS'Our results suggest that rapid activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway occurs directly through the chemokine receptor/G-proteins and independent of FAK activation.'
p2710
aS'Activated FAK also recruits PI3K, which mediates the activation of AKT and procures integrin-mediated cell survival, and likewise the antiapoptotic AKT can be activated via Ang-1 ['
p2711
aS'For example, integrin-triggered FAK signaling is essential for Ras- and PI3K-mediated oncogenesis    ['
p2712
aS' The role of integrins, FAK, Src, and PI3K/Akt differs depending on the cancer cell types.'

aS'In order to address the role of MEK1/2, the upstream kinase of ERK1/2, for the WNT-5A-induced changes in gene expression, we chose SL327 over more widely used PD98059 or UO126 because SL327 showed a higher solubility in ethanol over dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) among those substances.'

S'Is MYC expression alone altered in triple-negative tumors or is the expression of other MYC signaling components (i.e., competing MAX binding proteins) also changed?'
p7031
ag3157
aS'Prior studies have examined MYC expression in breast cancers; however, we find, for the first time, that the expression of multiple MAX binding partners, which can regulate MYC activity, is altered in triple-negative tumors and may therefore contribute to MYC pathway activity.'
p7032
aS'Although much remains to be elucidated, it is tempting to assume that binding of PU.1 to the low affinity canonical consensus may represent an important mechanism that controls physiological or pathological process through the differential dynamic combinations with other factors, such as MYC and MAX.'
