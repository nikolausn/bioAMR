In bone-specific interaction cluster, there are seven TFs: EF-C, MAZ, MIF1, GATA1, GATA2, GATA3 and RFX1.

('Myb', 'MYB', 'increases')
To gain insight into the mechanisms by which the Myb transcription factor controls normal hematopoiesis and particularly, how it contributes to leukemogenesis, we mapped the genome-wide occupancy of Myb by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) in ERMYB myeloid progenitor cells.
We next examined genome-wide Myb occupancy pattern in ERMYB cells using ChIP-Seq.
To provide further confidence, we carried out ChIP using pooled MYB antibodies (Myb 1-1 antibody and Thelma sera) in HL-60 cells, human leukemic pro-myeloblasts that represent a similar stage to ERMYB cells in myeloid development.

('Raf', 'MEK', 'adds_modification')
Activated Ras stimulates the ERK-MAP kinase cascade through the sequential phosphorylation of Raf, MEK and ERK.
The Raf/MEK/ERK cascade is a therapeutic target in human cancers with deregulated Ras signaling, which includes tumours that have inactivated the 
Cell intrinsic defects in the generation of T cells generally map to either T cell receptor (TCR) proximal signaling molecules or to two major pathways: the calcineurin/NFAT and Raf/MEK/Erk pathway 
Antibodies used were as follows: SMYD3 and MAP3K2me2/3 (generated by Yenzym); GST (generated by Covance); beta-Tubulin (05-661 Millipore); MAP3K2 (1662-1 Epitomics); Flag and ERK5 (F1804, E1523, Sigma); pERK1/2 and ERK1/2 and pMEK1/2 and MEK1/2 and pJNK and JNK and pP38 and P38 and pERK5 and pAKT and AKT and pCRaf and CRaf, PPP2R2a (4370, 4695, 9121, 9122, 9251, 9252, 9211, 9212, 3371, 2965, 4685, 9427, 9422, 5689, Cell Signaling); HA and Myc (26183, 21316 Pierce).
Sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor that blocks tumour cell proliferation by targeting the Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathway and exerts an antiangiogenic effect by targeting the tyrosine kinases of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-2, VEGFR-3, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-beta[
In turn, activated ERK1/2 can phosphorylate downstream substrates, such as c-Raf-1, MEK, Elk-1 and c-Fos, which regulate a variety of genes and proteins involved in apoptosis, such as bcl-2, caspase-3 and FasL[
In mammalian cells, ERK1/2 can be activated by a variety of stimuli, and in turn, the activated ERK1/2 can typically phosphorylate a number of downstream substrates, such as c-Raf-1, MEK, Elk-1, and c-Fos (Satoh et al., 2000).
To confirm the role of RTK signalling pathways in EBV infection, EGF-treated HNE1 and NPEC1-Bmi1 cells pre-incubated with inhibitors of tyrosine kinases (Genistein), MEK1/MEK2 (U0126), PI3K/AKT (LY294002), EGFR (Gefitinib) and VEGFR2/PDGFR/Raf signalling cascades (Sorafenib), were infected with EBV.
It has been previously reported that Raf/MEK/ERK signalling was linked to DNA damage response and DNA repair through an ATM-dependent process
One of the identified Smad2/3 partners was Araf, a member of Raf kinase family that, upon activation by Ras, normally activate MEK/ERKs
We propose that growth factor stimulation results in the docking of the ERK cascade components, Raf, MEK and ERK onto the cytoplasmic face of autophagic structures.
The two major Ras effector pathways that control cell proliferation and survival are Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3-K-AKT, respectively
Among these are MAPKs of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling pathway, including B-Raf (B-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma), MEK1 (MAPK or ERK kinase), ERK1/2 (ERKs 1 and 2) and kinase p38 (MAPK p38; overview in ref. 
The recombinant protein kinases (Raf, MEK and ERK) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology.
To identify the MAPK responsible for phosphorylation of PAP, we attempted to phosphorylate PAP using purified MAPKs Raf, MEK and ERK 
Extracellular mitogenic signals (triangles) leads to activation of Ras and the signaling through the Raf-MEK-ERK (MAPK) cascade to activate transcription factors such as Elk-1 and RREB1 resulting in proliferation and growth responses.
It was reported that E2F1 is located downstream of the MAPK signaling pathway and is activated by activation of the PKC/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway (

('STAT4', 'STAT5A', 'increases')
The STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) family of transcription factors comprises seven members (STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5A, STAT5B and STAT6), which are essential mediators of cytokine, growth factor and hormone responses.

Transfection of the MAZ expression plasmid BRB112 into the Flp-In 293 Myb WT reporter stable cells.
We would like to thank Dr Linda Boxer at Stanford University School of Medicine and Dr Kelly Jordan-Sciutto at the University of Pennsylvania for providing the plasmid LB178 from which we obtained the c-myb promoter and the plasmid BRB112 that is used for expression of FLAG-MAZ, respectively.

To assess whether reducing Cu binding in MEK1 affects BRAF
We next tested whether bypassing the requirement of MEK1/2 for Cu restores BRAF
While the detailed mechanism underlying the requirement of Cu for robust MEK1/2 kinase activity remains to be elucidated, we show that decreasing Cu influx, Cu bioavailability, and binding of Cu to MEK1 reduced MEK1(2) kinase activity and oncogenic BRAF-driven tumorigenesis.

Also, the TF table shows as significantly enriched a series of TFs (HNF4A, HNF4G, RXRA, FOXA1, and so on) known to be associated with tissue-specific gene expression in liver or liver development.
Human liver-enriched TRFs used in Matrix RNAi are as follows: HNF1A (TCF1), HNF1B (TCF2), HNF3A (FOXA1), HNF3B (FOXA2), HNF3G (FOXA3), HNF4A, HNF4G, HNF6A (ONECUT1), CEBPA, CEBPB, CEBPD, PPARA, PPARD, PPARG, RARA, RARB, RARG, RXRA, RXRB, RXRG, RORA and RORC.
For this purpose, we knocked down each of the three selected TRFs (FOXA1, ONECUT1 and RXRA) with two discrete siRNAs that targeted different sites in each of the TRF mRNAs.

('MAZ', 'FOXO4', 'increases')
In addition, sites for AP1, CREB, C/EBP, CCAAT-box factors, forkhead factors (FOXA, FOXD3, FOXO4, HFH8), E2F, GATA factors, GC-box factors, MAZR and PAX factors were enriched in down-regulated secondary target genes (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).

('PI3K', 'PDK1', 'increases_activity')
Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1, A001740), a pleckstrin-homology domain (PH-domain) containing protein kinase, is a well-characterized downstream effector of PI3K that has been suggested to act as a master regulator of the protein kinase A-protein kinase G-protein kinase C (AGC) family of kinases
In differentiated myofibres, Wnt7a binds to Fzd7 resulting in the activation of PI3K, which in turn activates phosphatidyl inositol-dependent kinase1 (PDK1).
PTEN: phosphatase and tensin homolog; mTORC1: mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; CNS: central nervous system; 4E-BP: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein; S6K: S6 kinase; PI3K: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; RTK: receptor tyrosine kinase; IRS-1: insulin receptor substrate 1; PDK1: phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1; TSC: tuberous sclerosis.
PI3K generates phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), leading to a cascade of signalling events, including the recruitment and activation/inactivation of several kinases, such as PDK1, AKT, and GSK3.
It is worth noting that in addition to the well-known kinases such as AKTs and PDK1 involved in the canonical PI3K signaling, there are six different kinases also containing the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that can bind to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3).
GHSR1a = GH secretagogue receptor 1a; CaMKK2 = calmodulin kinase kinase 2; AMPK = AMP-activated protein kinase; JAK2 = janus kinase 2; IRS = insulin receptor substrate; PI3K = phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PDK1 = phospholipid-dependent kinase 1; PKB = protein kinase B; TSC1/2 = tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (hamartin) and 2 (tuberin); Rheb = Ras homolog enriched in brain.

('ETS2', 'ETS1', 'increases')
Interestingly, the occupancy of UBF to UCE, CORE, ENH, ETS1, ETS2 and ETS3 regions of the rDNA promoter was markedly increased in ESET ON cells compared with control cells without ESET induction (
When overexpressed, the ETS proteins ETS1, ETS2 and ETV1 can activate ETS/AP-1 regulated reporter genes (

('STAT6', 'STAT5A', 'increases')
The STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) family of transcription factors comprises seven members (STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5A, STAT5B and STAT6), which are essential mediators of cytokine, growth factor and hormone responses.

('DAG', 'PKC', 'increases_activity')
Taken together, these results indicate that an ordered cascade of nPKCs functions downstream of DAG to promote MTOC reorientation in T cells.
Given the importance of synaptically localized DAG for MTOC reorientation, we hypothesized that nPKCs, which contain high affinity C1 domains, would be recruited to the IS and play a role in the polarization response.
DAG binding by nPKCs is mediated by the tandem C1 domains located N-terminal to the kinase domain
We next tested whether PLC, a downstream target of RTK signaling, was also activated in a polarized fashion, using an improved DAG sensor to monitor whether PLC-generated DAG was polarized in migrating cells (PKC
Since protein kinase C (PKC) is a main intracellular target of DAG and since PKCs have a role in regulating actin polymerization by phosphorylating actin regulators such as MARCKS, adducin, fascin, and ERM proteins
ER: Estrogen receptor; IP3: inositol-trisphosphate; DAG: diacyl glycerol; PKC: protein kinase C; MEK: mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase kinase; RSK: ribosomal S6 kinase; GAB1: Grb2-associated binder-1; CaMKK: Ca
The activation of cPKCs requires diacylglycerol (DAG) as an activator and phosphatidylserine (PS) and Ca
Unlike chimaerins, DAG-regulated PKCs contain two C1 domains in tandem (C1a and C1b).
The 3 isoforms, PRKD1, PRKD2, and PRKD3, contain highly conserved structural motifs within their regulatory domains and are directly activated by phorbolesters, diacylglycerol (DAG), or DAG-activated protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms.
Unexpectedly, DAG-induced ATP release was found to be independent of PKC activation, but dependent upon activation of a C1 domain-containing protein.
The inhibition of calcium oscillations by calphostin C suggests that astrocytic ATP release is mediated via a DAG-binding protein other than PKC.
I have shown, using in vitro live imaging, that stimulation of the DAG pathway with the DAG analogue, OAG, results in ATP release that appears to be both PKC independent and vesicular.
DAG activation of PKC has long been known to potentiate synaptic function    [
A potential role of DAG will be discussed further below in the context of a role for PKC.
PKC is physiologically activated by DAG, and this can occur subsequent to stimulation of PI-PLC, PC-PLC or PLD (see above) and, in some types of smooth muscle, may contribute to the sustained phase of contraction (Aburto et al. 

('HNF4A', 'FOXA1', 'increases')
This approach led to detection of both known and/or novel combinatorial regulatory sites, which were targeted by several liver-enriched TRFs [HNF1A, HNF3A (FOXA1, HGNC symbol), HNF3B (FOXA2), HNF3G (FOXA3) and HNF4A] in the three liver-enriched TRF genes, HNF1A, CEBPA and HNF3G.

('GATA3', 'FOXA1', 'increases')
This validation was carried out for MRs whose regulons were enriched in the cancer and normal breast tissue, but not in T-ALL: ESR1, FOXA1, GATA3 and SPDEF.
Bioinformatic analysis using position weight matrices (PWM, consensus binding motifs) from Transfac showed a strong enrichment of binding motifs for ESR1, FOXA1 and GATA3 in each of their identified regulons (
Having defined the regulons, we investigated how risk SNPs are distributed among them and carried out a cis-eQTL analysis between the risk SNP list (AVS) and the genes in the regulons for each of the MRs. Our analysis showed a statistically significant enrichment for genes in the ESR1, GATA3 and FOXA1 regulons with breast cancer risk SNPs but not prostate, colon or BMD risk SNPs (
In conclusion, we demonstrate that at least three of the identified MRs, ESR1, GATA3 and FOXA1 are linked to risk gene expression.

('PI3K', 'AKT1', 'adds_modification')
To test whether phosphorylation of cortactin could also be regulated by AKT1 in other cells with alterations in the PI3K signaling pathway, we used another isogenic cell line pair derived from the colorectal cancer cell line DLD1
In summary, mutant PI3K-induced signaling events uncovered by our phosphoproteomic approaches along with the newly identified AKT1 substrates should be invaluable for research as well as clinical studies involving development of novel targeted therapies.
AKT1 mediated phosphorylation on cortactin is important for migration/invasion induced by activation of PI3K.

('AR', 'FOXA1', 'increases')
Cistromes and epigenomes assessed in these cell lines for factors and modifications including FOXA1, ESR2, AR and H3K4me1 did not show enrichment for the BCa AVS, demonstrating that the enrichment of the BCa AVS is cell-type-specific (
(a) Proportion of ChIP-seq enriched regions discovered as DNaseI hypersensitive (DHS) sites for CTCF (left), androgen receptor (AR, center) and FOXA1 (right) in LNCaP cells.
The pioneering factor FOXA1 opens chromatin to facilitate androgen receptor (AR) binding to prostate-specific genes.
How FOXA1 controls the AR cistrome, however, is incompletely understood.
FOXA1 is not required for AR-chromatin interaction, but instrumental in recruiting AR to low-affinity half-AREs by opening local chromatin around adjacent FKHD sites.
Too much FOXA1 creates excessive open chromatin regions, which serve as reservoirs that retain AR via abundant half-AREs, thereby reducing its availability for specific sites.
FOXA1 down-regulation, by contrast, relinquishes AR to permissively bind AREs across the genome, resulting in substantial AR binding events and AR-target gene expression even in the absence of androgen.
Taken together, our data illustrate the mechanistic details by which cooperativity and equilibrium with FOXA1 define AR cistrome and reveal a previously unknown function of FOXA1 in inhibiting AR signaling and castration-resistant prostate cancer growth.
Genome-wide location analyses comparing FOXA1-bound genomic regions in prostate and breast cancer cells have revealed cell type-specific recruitment, which subsequently dictates distinct AR and ER chromatin-binding patterns in prostate and breast cells, respectively
To determine how FOXA1 defines AR binding profile, we first conducted FOXA1 knockdown (KD) in LNCaP PCa cells and then performed AR and FOXA1 ChIP-Seq in both control and knockdown cells (
Our data thus strongly suggest a shifted and gained AR program in PCa cells following the silencing of FOXA1.
Motif analysis revealed that strong ARBS (shared and shFOXA1-only) were characterized by high (~30%) incidences of full-ARE motif, while only 7% of shCtrl-only ARBS contained an ARE (
To test the importance of direct AR-chromatin interaction, we generated AR mutants C562S and G568W that are deficient in DNA binding but remained capable of interacting with the FOXA1 protein (
To engineer an independent model to further examine how FOXA1 regulates AR binding profile, we overexpressed AR in the FOXA1-negative DU145 cells to generate stable cell lines (DU145+AR) (
We engineered DU145+AR cells to express very high amount of FOXA1 (
As FOXA1 has been previously shown to open up compact chromatin to facilitate the access of other transcription factors including AR
Next we investigated how excessive FOXA1 results in immense loss of total AR binding events as illustrated in 
We generated an AR mutant (Q640X) that only expresses the AR protein up to position 640 which has been previously shown unable to interact with the FOXA1 protein
Concordantly, we found that in the absence of FOXA1, the intensity of ARE-only ARBS was the same as those bound to ARE+FKHD sites, both of which were significantly stronger than the FKHD-only sites (
In view of the great increase of ARBS following the silencing of FOXA1 in the endogenous LNCaP system, we asked whether AR might be a direct target of FOXA1-mediated transcriptional repression
To determine whether this FOXA1 binding event leads to regulation of AR gene expression, QRT-PCR was carried out and showed that AR and KLK3 expression were indeed significantly increased following FOXA1 KD (
We first examined whether FOXA1 continues to inhibit AR in the absence of androgen.
QRT-PCR and western blot analysis demonstrated that FOXA1 KD in hormone-deprived LNCaP cells increased AR expression and led to significant upregulation of KLK3 transcript as well as protein (
To do this we categorized these ARBS into control-only, shFOXA1-only and shared, and examined these binding profiles in both androgen-deprived and androgen-stimulated conditions.
Heatmap view of ChIP-seq read intensity confirmed remarkable AR recruitment to the shFOXA1-only sites upon FOXA1 KD, despite a clear loss of FOXA1 binding (
To determine the AR-mediated transcriptional program, we carried out microarray analysis of control and FOXA1-KD LNCaP cells grown in androgen-depleted medium.
Previous studies have established a model wherein FOXA1 protein acts as a pioneering factor that interacts with and recruits AR to lineage-specific binding sites
Had FOXA1 not affected AR-chromatin binding, AR would have been relinquished to bind ARE motifs across the genome, which are not specific to prostate genes.
On the other hand, had FOXA1 directly recruited AR to the genome AR would potentially get recruited to all FOXA1 binding sites, which would ultimately dilute AR and inhibits AR-mediated activation of prostate-specific genes.
Our model, by contrast, showed that when FOXA1 is in equilibrium with AR, it opens up the chromatin to preferably facilitate AR co-occupancy at FKHD+ARE sites (high-affinity and highly accessible), but reduces AR binding to ARE-only sites (high affinity but not accessible).
Therefore, our study not only supports previously reported roles of FOXA1 in specifying lineage-specific AR program
In this study we have also shown that FOXA1 directly inhibits AR expression and thus the transcription of its target genes.
Interestingly, consistent with our results, a recent study has shown that FOXA1 overexpression largely inhibits AR target genes in PCa cells
Antibodies used in this study include anti-AR (06-680) from Millipore, anti-FOXA1 (ab23738), Histone H3 (ab1791) and anti-GAPDH (ab9385) from Abcam, anti-AR (sc-7305) from Santa Cruz, and anti-KLK3 (K2889-100UG) from Sigma (
Cells with coexpression of FOXA1(tagged with Flag) and AR (wild type or mutant) were lyzed in IP lysis buffer (50mM Tris-Cl pH7.4, 150mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, Roche protease inhibitor cocktail).
Western blotting analysis were performed using rabbit anti-FOXA1(ab23738, Abcam) or rabbit anti-AR(06-680, Millipore).
AR and FOXA1 ChIP were carried out as described previously
In keeping with the role of PIAS1 as a SUMOylation pathway component, PIAS1, AR, and FOXA1 co-occurring genomic sites were also generally bound by SUMO2/3 and the binding of SUMO2/3 was markedly enhanced by androgen exposure (Figure 
Androgen-enhanced co-occurrence of SUMO2/3 at AR-, PIAS1- and FOXA1-shared genomic locations.

Red bars below the tracks depict the positions of the identified peak sites and red arrows sites co-occupied by AR, PIAS1, FOXA1 and SUMO2/3.
FOXA1 depletion has been shown to elicit extensive redistribution of ARBs on prostate cancer cell chromatin (
PIAS1 was able to bind to chromatin, mainly at FOXA1 motif-containing sites in the absence of added androgen, but androgen exposure increased the number of PIAS1-binding sites markedly, resulting in practically complete overlap with about one tenth of the AR cistrome.
PIAS1 sites resulting from the androgen exposure showed enrichment for AREs and FOXA1 motifs at about the same frequency of 50%.
The genes associated with cell growth, apoptosis and cancer listed in the previous paragraph are prominent examples of AR-, PIAS1- and FOXA1-co-occupied enhancers.
In comparison to FOXA1 depletion which elicits extensive redistribution of ARBs on prostate cancer cell chromatin (
In line with the interaction of FOXA1 with PIAS1 as a SUMOylation pathway component, we have recently shown that FOXA1 is SUMOylated and that the modification modulates its activity and interaction with AR (
Androgen-bound ARs recruit PIAS1 to chromatin enhancer sites that are neighbored by FOXA1 and surrounded by active chromatin H3 methyl marks.
PIAS1 subsequently promotes SUMO2/3 (S2/3) modification of FOXA1 and/or AR and other factors, which also influences interactions with coregulator proteins (CoR).
However, there were significant differences in the enrichment of other transcription factor-binding motifs between the wtAR-preferred and the AR-SUMOylation mutant-preferred ARBs: motifs for pioneer transcription factor FOXA1 and C/EBP occurred more frequently among the wtAR-preferred ARBs, whereas AP-1 motif was more prevalent among the AR-2KR preferred ARBs.
The motif analyses thus imply that SUMOylation may influence the AR chromatin occupancy and target gene selection via regulating interactions with other sequence-specific transcription factors, such as FOXA1 and AP-1, which may enhance or weaken the AR binding to the chromatin.
Human liver-enriched TRFs used in Matrix RNAi are as follows: HNF1A (TCF1), HNF1B (TCF2), HNF3A (FOXA1), HNF3B (FOXA2), HNF3G (FOXA3), HNF4A, HNF4G, HNF6A (ONECUT1), CEBPA, CEBPB, CEBPD, PPARA, PPARD, PPARG, RARA, RARB, RARG, RXRA, RXRB, RXRG, RORA and RORC.

In turn, activated ERK1/2 can phosphorylate downstream substrates, such as c-Raf-1, MEK, Elk-1 and c-Fos, which regulate a variety of genes and proteins involved in apoptosis, such as bcl-2, caspase-3 and FasL[
Among these cascades, the rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF)-mitogen-activated protein kinases (MEK)-extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) pathway has been strongly implicated in axon growth signaling, while the PI3 kinase (PI3K)-AKT-mTOR pathway has been predominantly linked to anti-apoptotic and anabolic signaling.
In this study, two cell signaling pathway inhibitors, PD98059 and SB203580, were used to block the MEK-ERK and p38MAPK signaling pathways respectively.

Evidence suggests that the MEK-ERK and p38MAPK signaling pathways are involved in apr-BYHWD-induced BMSC differentiation.
In summary, MEK-ERK and p38MAPK signaling pathways are involved in apr-BYHWD-induced BMSC differentiation into neurons.
Blocking MEK-ERK and p38MAPK signaling pathways can inhibit the effect of apr-BYHWD induction.
In mammalian cells, ERK1/2 can be activated by a variety of stimuli, and in turn, the activated ERK1/2 can typically phosphorylate a number of downstream substrates, such as c-Raf-1, MEK, Elk-1, and c-Fos (Satoh et al., 2000).

In summary, our data demonstrate a role for MLKs as direct activators of the MEK/ERK pathway with implications for melanomagenesis and resistance to RAF inhibitors.
Aberrant activation of the MEK/ERK pathway leads to tumorigenesis and the role of mutationally activated BRAF as a driver of metastatic melanoma has been well established
Based on our proposed mechanism whereby MLKs can activate the MEK/ERK pathway in a manner independent of the RAF kinases, we sought to determine whether MLKs may mediate reactivation of this pathway in the presence of RAF inhibitors in V600E-positive melanoma cells.
We observed that expression of MLKs reactivated the MEK/ERK pathway in the presence of vemurafenib in a kinase-dependent manner (
These data provide a new layer of complexity in regards to MAPK signalling; we have shown that the MLKs are not only able to phosphorylate MKK4/7 to regulate the JNK pathway, but also MEK1/2 to regulate the ERK pathway.
It was previously reported that MLK3 acts as a scaffold for BRAF to activate the MEK/ERK pathway; however, our data demonstrate that the MLKs act directly at the level of MEK, and through phosphorylation of MEK can activate ERK.
Much remains to be determined regarding the nature of when and how the MLKs regulate the MEK/ERK pathway and future studies should reveal exciting revelations regarding the molecular mechanisms important for differential regulation of downstream components.

We propose that growth factor stimulation results in the docking of the ERK cascade components, Raf, MEK and ERK onto the cytoplasmic face of autophagic structures.
Importantly, this conclusion is not restricted to transformed keratinocytes, as EGF-mediated Src, -MEK1, -ERK1/2 and -STAT3 phosphorylations were also severely impaired on KIAA1199 deficiency in breast cancer-derived MCF7 and SK-BR-3 cells, as well as in immortalized breast epithelial NMuMG cells (
As such, KIAA1199 critically controls EGF-mediated EMT through the Ras/MEK1/ERK1/2 pathway (

Nurr1 transcriptional activity is regulated by the MEK5/ERK5 signaling pathway.

The MAPKinases are divided into 3 distinct pathways: p38, JNK and MEK/ERK.
In order to determine which of these pathways is responsible for the upregulation of ECR2-TAC1prom synergy by angiotensin, we transfected primary sensory neurones with the ECR2-TAC1prom-Luc construct and incubated them in the presence of angiotensin and antagonists of the JNK (SP600125), p38 (SB202190) and MEK/ERK (PD98059) pathways.
Only PD98059 was able to significantly reverse the effects of angiotensin on the ECR2-TAC1prom-Luc construct, suggesting that MAPK control of ECR2-TAC1prom is modulated by the MEK/ERK pathway (fig. 
In order to address this possibility we transfected primary DRG neurones with the ECR2-TAC1prom-Luc plasmid and cultured them in the presence of capsaicin or capsaicin plus the MEK/ERK antagonist PD98059.
The significant upregulation of ECR2-TAC1-Luc activity observed following treatment with the antagonist SB202190 suggests that p38MAPK may play a role in antagonising the influence of MEK/ERK on the TAC1 gene.
