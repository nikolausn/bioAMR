('PI3K', 'PDK1', 'increases_activity')
The binding of growth factor or insulin to cell surface receptors activates PI3K, which converts the plasma membrane lipid PIP2 to PIP3, subsequently recruits PDK1 and Akt to the plasma.

The mutations occurring in AMLs are subdivided into three classes: class I mutations promote cell proliferation (examples of these mutations are FLT3, c-KIT, NRAS, and KRAS mutations); class II mutations inhibit cell differentiation (examples of these mutations are CEBPA, NPM1, CBF

In response to growth factors, hRAS signaling involves the following activation cascade: hRAS-RAF(MAPKKK)-MEK (MAPKK)-ERK (MAPK).
We recently reported that the mechanisms by which C1P exerts its mitogenic effects involve stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/Extracellularly regulated kinases 1-2 (ERK1-2), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt (or PKB), and c-Jun terminal kinase (JNK) pathways [

To test the hypothesis that ERK MAPK, Akt and/or eNOS activation participate in sphinganine 1-phosphate-mediated protection against liver IR induced AKI and liver injury, we pretreated the mice with PD98059 (an inhibitor of MEK1 to inhibit ERK phosphorylation, 1 mg/kg, i.p.
To determine whether Gi/o, ERK MAPK, Akt and/or eNOS signaling mediate the sphinganine 1-phosphate-mediated renal and hepatic protection after hepatic IR, mice were pretreated with pertussis toxin (an inhibitor of Gi/o signaling), PD98059 (a selective MEK1 inhibitor), wortmannin (a selective PI3K inhibitor) or L-NIO (a selective eNOS inhibitor) prior to sphinganine 1-phosphate treatment.

To evaluate the significance of ERK activity in cell death induced by Dex/MEK inhibitors co-treatment, we first established the CEM clones that express constitutively active MEK1 (ca-MEK1).
Stable transfection into CEM cells with a construct encoding MEK1 shRNA resulted in reduction of MEK1 expression, accompanied with a pronounced reduction of phospho-ERK1/2.
