p1412
aS'Our analysis shows that the patterns of differential mRNA and miRNA expression in growth-arrested, Rasless cells are clearly interdependent and, in addition, that they can undergo specific reversal after recovery of the proliferative ability of such cells through the introduction of activated BRAF or MEK1 kinases.'
p1413
aS'Interestingly, rescue of the proliferative ability of the Rasless cells by expressing activated BRAF or MEK1 ['
p1414
aS'As mentioned in previous sections, more than 80% of the transcriptional alterations occurring in Rasless cells are reversed by activated BRAF or MEK1 molecules.'
p1415
aS'Restoring the proliferative ability of those cells after ectopic expression of activated BRAF or MEK1 resulted in the reversal of a large proportion of the transcriptional mRNA and miRNA alterations identified, indicating that the altered mRNA and miRNA expression patterns are functionally interrelated and specifically associated with the disappearance of the Ras proteins in Rasless cells.'
p1416
aS'This hypothesis would also predict that reversing the transcriptional patterns of mRNA and miRNA differential expression of Rasless cells may lead to a parallel restoration of their proliferative abilities, similar to what happens in BRAF- or MEK1-rescued MEFs.'

aS'The sample set used in this report for mRNA expression studies included 27 independent hybridizations corresponding to 14 controls, 7 Rasless, 3 BRAF-rescued and 3 MEK1-rescued samples.'

p4372
aS'We found that the expression of FOXA1 and AR in ECs was significantly higher than that in a typical hyperplasia and normal tissues.'

aS'FOXA1 expression was significantly correlated with AR expression in clinical tissues.'

aS'ChIP-PCR assays showed that FOXA1 and AR could directly bind to the promoter and enhancer regions upstream of MYC.'

p4378
aS'In addition, we showed that down-regulation of AR attenuated FOXA1-up-regulated cell proliferation.'

aS'In the present study, we investigated the dependency of AR on FOXA1 expression in tissue paraffin sections, in multiple cellular contexts, and on tumor-bearing nude mice.'

aS'To explore the role of FOXA1 in the regulation of metastatic function and to determine whether AR is involved in FOXA1-mediated regulation of metastatic function, we examined the migration and invasion ability of MFE-296/shFOXA1 and AN3CA/exFOXA1 cells after exAR or siAR cotransfection using transwell migration and invasion assays.'
p4396
aS'Most FOXA1 studies have focused on its role as a pioneer factor that binds to DNA packaged in chromatin and opens the chromatin for binding of additional transcription factors including AR ['
p4397
aS'Although the underlying mechanisms governing the FOXA1-AR correlation in tumor progression are not fully understood, a pathway analysis showed that 187 FOXA1/AR dual target genes were involved in the cellular growth/proliferation pathway in liver cancer ['
p4398
aS'We further investigated the effects of FOXA1 and AR on migration and invasion of EC cells, and found that neutralization of AR activity did not inhibit FOXA1-enhanced cancer cell migration or invasion.'
p4399
aS'These observations indicate that the promoting effect of FOXA1 on migration and invasion is not dependent on AR.'
p4400
aS'Our findings in migration and invasion assays are consistent with our findings in immunohistochemical staining, which showed that higher expression of FOXA1 but not AR is found in tumors that displayed a greater depth of myometrial invasion.'
p4401
aS'These results suggest that AR is not the only downstream target of FOXA1 in EC.'
p4402
aS'In summary, our results suggest a new mechanism for the development of EC, in which FOXA1 promotes tumor cell proliferation through AR and activates the Notch pathway by influencing AR expression.'

p7120
aS'We suggest that the transcription factors SMAD3/4, GNB2L1/RACK1, MYC, MAX and JUN, whose functions have been extensively studied in tumours but only marginally in muscle, appear instead to play important roles in regulating muscle response to atrophy.'
p7121
aS'In particular, MYC and MAX genes are found by both analysis, whereas SMAD3/4 proteins seem to be replaced by JUN and GNB2L1/RACK1 in the short-term signature.'

aS'The transcription factors MYC and MAX represent hub proteins also in the specific network that describes the molecular interactions involved in the early steps of muscle atrophy and their central role in the general biological processes related to atrophy is therefore reinforced.'
p7123
aS'The high proportion of the genes are likely regulated by the E2F-family of transcription factors and/or c-MYC/MAX transcription factors suggesting common regulatory mechanisms may lead in to the phenotypic difference of EGFR TKI-sensitive and -resistant cells.'

aS'Interestingly, we identified a motif similar to the binding site of MYC-MAX (see Figure '

aS'Finally, we examined the specificity of MYC-MAX binding site at -260 to -246 of BRD7 minimal promoter.'
p7128
aS'MatInspector analysis revealed a MYC-MAX, an E2F6 and a Sp1/Myc-Max overlapping site in BRD7 minimal promoter, suggesting that transcription factor E2F6, c-Myc and Sp1 may be involved in regulating of BRD7 minimal promoter.'

aS"In contrast, the central core element of this large 5' enhancer corresponds to a common DNAse I footprint (121 cell types) which matches DNA fragments pulled by ChIP-Seq that targeted a variety of transcription factors, including RNA Pol II, c-MYC-MAX, EGR-1, ETS-1 and ELF-1."

p7136
aS'Overexpression of c-MYC and MAD proteins in SEG1 cells resulted in differential expression of MYC/MAX/MAD network members and reciprocal changes in proliferation.'

aS'In conclusion, the expression patterns of c-MYC, MAX and the MAD family were shown to be deregulated in the oesophageal cancer model.'
p7138
aS'c-MYC is an oncogenic transcription factor, which, as part of a heterodimeric complex with MAX, activates the expression of a diverse range of genes implicated in cellular processes such as cell growth, proliferation, loss of differentiation and apoptosis ('
p7139
aS'The MAD family of transcriptional repressors, including MAD1 and MXI1, also bind to MAX and are believed to antagonise the activity of MYC proteins by competing for MAX-binding and interaction with E-box sequences in target gene promoters, and by actively repressing transcription of MYC target genes ('
