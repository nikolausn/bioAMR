The binding of leptin to its specific receptor activates various intracellular signaling pathways, including Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/ signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), insulin receptor substrate (IRS)/phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K), SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/ acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues.
The binding of leptin to LepRb activates a number of signaling pathways, JAK2/STAT 3 and STAT5, IRS/PI3K, SHP2/MAPK, and AMPK/ACC (

At a cellular level, nerve growth factor (NGF) up-regulates CGRP via the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1 (MEK-1)/p42/p44 pathway (
The Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK is the second principal pathway associated with activation of IGF-IR.
This downstream cascade includes the activation of the small G protein Ras followed by the activation of protein serine kinase Raf, which in turn activates the MEK/MAPK pathway (Figure 
Arrestins can act as adaptors for signaling molecules, for example cRaf1 and the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), both of which can bind to MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), and could therefore participate in MAPK activation (
The authors identified NADPH oxidase activation and the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway to be crucial for NET formation (Hakkim et al., 
The first step of the NETotic cascade is stimulation of one or several receptors followed by activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway that culminates in the assembly of the multimeric NADPH oxidase complex and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
Kinase suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR1) is a scaffolding protein that interacts with several components of the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade to co-ordinate the formation of localized multi-protein complexes that enable efficient signal transduction (
Src sequentially recruits an intermediary protein Grb2 and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS, initiating the GTP loading and activation of Ras and the activation of the Raf, MEK and ERK kinase cascade.
Regulation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathways in apoptosis is partly due to the post-translational phosphorylation of Bcl-2 family members including Bad, Bim, Mcl-1, and more controversially Bcl-2 (
Structurally related to Perifosine, it inhibits Akt, but also impacts other signaling pathways (most prominently, Raf-MEK-ERK)
Altogether, these studies highlight two important points regarding reovirus oncolysis: (1) although prior studies implicate the Ras/RalGEF/p38 pathway in the promotion of reovirus oncolysis independent of Raf and JNK signaling, MEK/ERK, and JNK appear to have roles in reovirus infectivity and reovirus-induced apoptosis, and (2) further understanding of the reovirus infectious cycle has demonstrated that 
Deregulation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway is a common event in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and is caused by point mutation, gene deletion, and chromosomal translocation of a vast array of gene types, highlighting its importance in leukemia biology.
The core of the signaling pathway comprises three dual-specific protein kinases Raf, MEK, ERK, and the G-protein Ras.
Raf subsequently activates MEK1/2, which display restricted substrate specificity for ERK1/2.
The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway (now abbreviated to Ras pathway) is also implicated in the regulation of apoptosis by enhancing gene expression of pro-survival Bcl-2 family proteins and targeting anti-apoptotic proteins for proteasomal degradation (
An interesting study has teased apart the relative importance of Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways in a mouse model of T lineage ALL and shown that both effector pathways are drivers of aberrant growth initiated by 
Perhaps, the most promising approach would be the dual inhibition of FLT3 and other pro-survival pathways, such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR, JAK/STAT5, or RAS/Raf/MEK/ERK inhibitors, and clinical trials investigating novel dual inhibitors (NCT02055781) or combining kinase inhibitors (NCT00819546) are underway
Phosphorylation of the IRS adapter molecules on one hand triggers activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway, whereas, on the other hand, the Shc adapter activates signaling by the Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk signaling pathway (
Besides the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, inflammatory signal-related pathway also plays important role for pancreatic carcinogenesis.
For instance, ERK exhibits a strong negative feedback to Raf-1 in response to EGF which alters the efficiency of MEK inhibition (Sturm et al., 
KSR interacts with, B-Raf, C-Raf, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 coordinating the assembly of these components into a multiprotein complex (Therrien et al., 
Consider a set of 2 Raf, 5 MEK, and 10 ERK molecules (as shown in Figure 
Also, the ternary interaction of the scaffold KSR1 with B-Raf and MEK is highly dynamic.
When docking of ERK is impaired by a mutation, the KSR1-MEK-B-Raf complex persists even 20 min after stimulation, where otherwise, almost all B-Raf has left the complex at this time.
KSR1 can also route signals to the cytoplasm: in addition to binding Raf and MEK, KSR1 (but also other scaffolds such as Sef and IQGAP1) helps to assemble ERK1/2 dimers that are essential for interaction of ERK with cytoplasmic substrates (Casar et al., 
In theory, the three-tiered MAPK cascade comprising single phosphorylation of Raf and dual phosphorylation of MEK and ERK, is inherently ultrasensitive (Huang and Ferrell, 
The downstream Raf kinase activates MEK1/2 MAP kinase, which in turn activates extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) (Dhingra et al., 
Both the PI 3-Kinase and the Ras/Raf/MEK signaling pathways are activated by other class I cytokines, including interleukin 6 (IL-6).

As a result, the top-ranked nodes are the usual suspects, such as AKT1, P53, and RAF1.

('MYC', 'FOXO3', 'increases')
FOXO3a, a transcription factor that is inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway and is upregulated in hypoxia, has emerged as an important negative regulator of MYC function.
Recent studies have revealed that FOXO3a acts as a negative regulator of mitochondrial function through inhibition of MYC.
This review will focus on the antagonism between FOXO3a and MYC and discuss their role in cellular bioenergetics, reactive oxygen metabolism, and adaptation to hypoxia, raising questions about the role of FOXO proteins in cancer.
Two recent studies have demonstrated that the inhibition of nuclearly encoded mitochondrial genes by FOXO3a involves inhibition of MYC though multiple mechanisms (Figure 
FOXO3a is also able to modulate MYC transcriptional activity by additional mechanisms to reduce ROS production in hypoxic cells.

('PI3K', 'PDK1', 'increases_activity')
Phosphoinoisitide dependent kinase l (PDK1) phosphorylates a key threonine residue within the catalytic domain of a number of AGC family kinases, including diacylglycerol-regulated kinases of the protein kinase C (PKC) superfamily and phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI3K)-controlled serine kinases such as Akt/PKB and the 70-kilodalton ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) 
Mammalian target of rapamycin function is regulated by the activity state of several neuronal surface receptors and channels (i.e., TrkB, NMDAR, AMPA, D1R, D2R, mGluRs) and by diverse signaling cascades activated by these receptors, including PDK1, PI3K, Akt, and TSC1/2 (Averous and Proud, 
Antibodies for the phospho-specific and total (recognizing both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated protein) forms of Akt, ERK1/2, JAK2, and STAT5, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked anti-rabbit IgG antibody, biotinylated molecular weight marker, anti-biotin-HRP antibody, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) inhibitor U0126 (MEK1 and 2 are directly responsible for the activation of ERK), PI3K inhibitor LY294002 [PI3K produces phosphatidylinositol phosphates that are critical for activation of Akt by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1)], and cell lysis buffer were all obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA).
In adipocytes and muscles PI3K-PDK1-Akt are the protein kinases that are activated in a cascade after insulin receptor stimulation and Rab8, Rab10, and Rab14 the small GTPases that drive GSV translocation to the cell surface.
Upon ligation of the T cell receptor (TCR) in the presence of co-stimulatory molecules, PI3K recruitment and activation leads to the production of lipid products which in turn recruit downstream PH-domain containing targets such as PDK1 and Akt (see 
by inactivating PI3K or downstream proteins such as PDK1 or mTOR) or by increasing PI3K signaling (e.g.
The activation of PI3K stimulates the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate at the cell membrane, which mediates the recruitment of PKB (also known as AKT) and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1).
Some TNFR family molecules in non-T cells appear to have the capacity to activate PI3K and Akt without signaling from other receptors, suggesting they may directly phosphorylate PI3K and/or recruit other kinases that can perform this function, and they may also recruit kinases such as PDK1 that phosphorylate Akt.
The serine/threonine kinase Akt is known to be regulated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling via the activatory phosphorylation of Akt at its threonine (Thr 308) and its serine (Ser 473) residues by two phosphatidyl-dependant kinases, PDK1 and PDK2/rictor-mTOR, respectively (Scheid and Woodgett, 
The signaling cascades triggered by PI3K, including PDK1, AKT, and SGK among others, promote cell growth and survival.
Indeed, targeting this pathway may cause MYC activation through PDK1-dependent MYC phosphorylation and MYC amplification, which is parallel to PIK3CA-dependent Akt and MAPK activation, thus attenuating the therapeutic effect of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors (

('DAG', 'PKC', 'increases_activity')
The PKC activation induced by hyperglycemia is likely due to the increase in the 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) levels, a physiological activator of PKC, although other co-factors such as phosphatidylserine (PS) or phorbolester (PE) are also known stimulants.
Enhanced PKC activation, as a result of hyperglycemia-mediated DAG production and an increased rate of ceramide synthesis, is associated with impairment in renal functions.
In contrast, other work suggests that DAG can also activate a PKC-independent pathway.
A PKC-independent DAG-gated cation current was described in patch clamp recordings from cultured ORNs of 
In recent years, it has become clear that DAG can activate targets other than PKC, some of which are important for vesicle fusion.
There are additional targets of the regulation of mucin secretion besides Synaptotagmin and Munc13 proteins, such as PKC that also binds DAG and calcium (
The regulatory domains of cPKCs contain a C1 domain that functions as diacylglycerol (DAG)/phorbol 12-myristat 13-acetat (PMA) binding motif and a C2 domain that binds anionic phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner (
Unless it is post-translationally or co-translationally phosphorylated, PKCs are incapable of being activated by DAG or other cofactors (
New roles in regulation of microfilaments were recently ascribed tor cPKCs that are activated by DAG and by Ca
The importance of localized DAG, however, argued against a role for aPKCs, at least during the early phases of the response.
Although differential DAG affinity provides an elegant mechanism for modulating PKC recruitment, other results strongly suggest that there are additional contributing factors.
It is conceivable that polarity complexes are recruited to the IS by DAG and nPKC signaling.
Downstream to DAG, MTOC dynamics and polarization is driven by PKC isozymes recruited to the synaptic membrane.
Besides binding PKC DAG also binds to RAS-guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (Ras-GRP).
Phorbol-esters such as PMA represent surrogates of the second messenger 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) and are less rapidly degraded, which makes them the preferred activators of PKC used in cell culture as well as in 
Diacylglycerol (DAG) leads to PKC activation, whereas inositol triphosphate (IP3) triggers calcium (Ca
Unlike IP3, which is released into the spine cytoplasm, DAG is embedded in the membrane and recruits and activates DAG effectors (among them PKC), which have been involved in spine maintenance (Brose et al., 
DAG activates PKC, which then attaches itself to the AMPA receptors and decreases the number of AMPA receptors by internalizing them.
Similarly the DAG upon activation diffuses into the cell fluid and docks on the PKC activating it.
This problem was particularly pronounced when voltage gated ion channels, the contribution of calcium to the increase in electron transport chain, uncoupling protein activation, DAG activation, PKC activation, and CaMKII activation were being modeled.
The main intracellular pathways activated by BDNF-TrkB signaling are the MEK-ERK, the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1, the PLCy-DAG-PKC/Ca

For instance, ERK exhibits a strong negative feedback to Raf-1 in response to EGF which alters the efficiency of MEK inhibition (Sturm et al., 

('AR', 'FOXA1', 'increases')
Over the past few years, progress has been made in our understanding of how FOXA1 influences nuclear receptor function, with both common and distinct roles in the regulation of ER or AR.
Furthermore, there is evidence of somatic changes that influence the DNA sequence under FOXA1 binding regions, which may indirectly influence FOXA1-mediated regulation of ER and AR activity.
If AR driven prostate cancers readily acquire ligand independence, elevated FOXA1-AR activity would be an advantage to the tumor, supporting the observation that high FOXA1 is a marker of poor patient outcome.
It will be critical to determine the key ER and AR target gene changes at high and low FOXA1 levels and any differences in the associated AR/ER protein complexes.

('HRAS', 'RAF1', 'adds_modification')
Whilst most prior sources are able to obtain significant results for HRAS, MAP2K1, MAPK1, and RAF1, significant results for half the prior sources for CDK5 and MAPK3 they struggle to provide meaningful information for inference of gene interactions in the context of colorectal cancer with the remaining two knock-downs (MAP2K2 and NGFR).
For the remaining four knock-downs, the best prior source is consistent for two out of the three data sets: PN for CDK5, MAP2K2, and RAF1 and GM2 for HRAS.

To refine the results of our large-scale siRNA screen, we performed an integrative analysis of our siRNA screen regulators by cross-referencing these regulators with a list of genes previously identified in melanoma, and a list of gene products phosphorylated downstream of MEK and ERK in melanoma.
The FAM129B gene was identified via integration of 3 datasets, including Wnt signaling modifiers, melanoma-associated genes and the MEK/ERK phosphoproteome.
FAM129B was the only gene that overlapped with all three datasets, making it a promising candidate for regulation of both Wnt and MEK/ERK pathways in melanoma.
The following steps are illustrated: (A) Binding of ERK1/2 with anchor proteins in resting cells; (B) stimulation is followed by phosphorylation of the TEY motif of ERK1/2 by MEK1/2, and detachment of ERK1/2 from their anchors; (C) phosphorylation of ERK1/2 on its SPS motif by CKII.

The figure illustrates how MEK, DUSP5 and DUSP6/MKP-3 cooperate to regulate ERK responses in the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively.
The cytosolic kinase, MEK is the only known MKK for ERK and anchors ERK in the cytoplasm under basal conditions.
Activation of MEK by the RAF MAPK kinase kinase causes phosphorylation of ERK and dissociation of MEK.
The NES of DUSP6/MKP-3 and high affinity for ERK binding, irrespective of phosphorylation state enables competition with MEK and other ERK partners and substrates in the cytoplasm, causing sequestration of dephosphorylated ERK in this compartment.
It has been known for some time that sustained (but not transient) activation of MEK often causes nuclear accumulation of ERK in the dephosphorylated form and is coincident with ERK-dependent fate choices such as G

Our findings suggest that it cannot be ERK itself; intra-LA infusion of the MEK inhibitor U0126, which would presumably affect ERK activation both pre- and post-synaptically, has no effect on training-induced elevations of EGR-1 in the MGm/PIN (Figure 
In particular, it was shown that blockade of ERK phosphorylation with SL327, an inhibitor of MEK, reduced the development of dyskinesia (Santini et al., 
To test the involvement of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade in behavioral immunization, either D-AP5 or the MEK inhibitor U0126 was injected to the prelimbic (PL) or infralimbic (IL) mPFC prior to controllable stress exposure.
To test whether the ERK cascade is critical to the behavioral immunization phenomenon, rats were implanted with cannula for microinjection into the PL of the mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126.

The top three nodes identified in this fashion in MAPK pathways, for example, are MEK2, JNK and ASK1, which reside on ERK1/2, JNK and p38 cascades respectively.
Activation of MAPK triggers the activation of the small GTPase Ras (Ras family) and a kinase cascade including MEK1 and 2 (STE Ser/Thr protein kinase family), ERKs (CMGC Ser/Thr protein kinase family), p90RSK (AGC Ser/Thr protein kinase family), and a transcription factor ELK1 (ETS family).

First, our data demonstrate that both the MEK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways are essential for proliferation of adult spinal cord NSPCs.
Collectively, these findings suggest that while the PI3K/Akt pathway may be distinctly pivotal for proliferation of ESCs and embryonic cortical progenitor cells, proliferation of adult neural stem and progenitor cells involves both the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK1/2 pathways in a non-overlapping manner (Table

In addition to the above mechanisms of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors, RTK overexpression or activation has been shown to bypass mutant BRAF and reactivate ERK through CRAF-MEK or via ERK independent mechanisms by activating the PI3K/AKT pathways.
Should this be the case, it is noteworthy that several chemical inhibitors of MEK1 (the upstream regulator of ERK2) exist; thus, this strategy could be tested in clinic.
These include the canonical PI3K/AKT pathway, but also the RAS/MEK/ERK signaling axis (Yang et al.,

Classically, the c-Jun phosphorylation at serine 63 and 73 believes through the ERKs signaling pathway because MEK inhibitors suppress the phosphorylation of c-Jun at serine 63 and 73 when cells are stimulated by growth factors such as EGF.
RAF proteins are kinases in RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway.
The analysis is based on the kinetic model of Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/AKT signaling developed in Ref.
The canonical pathway of mTOR activation depends on mitogen-driven signaling through PI3K/Akt, although alternative non-Akt dependent activation through the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway is now recognized (
Structurally related to Perifosine, it inhibits Akt, but also impacts other signaling pathways (most prominently, Raf-MEK-ERK)
Altogether, these studies highlight two important points regarding reovirus oncolysis: (1) although prior studies implicate the Ras/RalGEF/p38 pathway in the promotion of reovirus oncolysis independent of Raf and JNK signaling, MEK/ERK, and JNK appear to have roles in reovirus infectivity and reovirus-induced apoptosis, and (2) further understanding of the reovirus infectious cycle has demonstrated that 
The core of the signaling pathway comprises three dual-specific protein kinases Raf, MEK, ERK, and the G-protein Ras.
Raf subsequently activates MEK1/2, which display restricted substrate specificity for ERK1/2.
The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway (now abbreviated to Ras pathway) is also implicated in the regulation of apoptosis by enhancing gene expression of pro-survival Bcl-2 family proteins and targeting anti-apoptotic proteins for proteasomal degradation (
An interesting study has teased apart the relative importance of Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways in a mouse model of T lineage ALL and shown that both effector pathways are drivers of aberrant growth initiated by 
Perhaps, the most promising approach would be the dual inhibition of FLT3 and other pro-survival pathways, such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR, JAK/STAT5, or RAS/Raf/MEK/ERK inhibitors, and clinical trials investigating novel dual inhibitors (NCT02055781) or combining kinase inhibitors (NCT00819546) are underway
In melanoma cells, constitutive BRAF/MEK/ERK signaling drives cell cycle entry and uncontrolled growth by increasing cyclin D1 expression.
As described above, hBVR binds to ERK1/2 and to its upstream activating kinases MEK1/2 (Lerner-Marmarosh et al., 
Examination of the role of hBVR in activation of kinases, such as PKCs and MEK1/2, that function upstream of ERK1/2 has led to development of hBVR-based peptides that have introduced a new dimension to the regulation of ERK signaling.
ERK1/2 is directly activated by MAPK-kinase (MEK1/2).
The proteome array demonstrated that regardless of sensitivity, members of the Src kinases, pERK and pMEK were inhibited following exposure to PF-3758309 (data not shown).
In a second type of resistance mechanism, the effect of the drug is evaded by making irrelevant the function of the EGFR itself, while ensuring downstream signaling via the PI3K/aKT or RaS/RaF/MEK/ERK pathways.
Although the mechanism of crosstalk between PKA and ERK pathways has not yet been clarified, it is possible that PKA pathway facilitates MEK1/2 which activates the ERK1/2 pathway (Stork and Schmitt, 
ERK1 and ERK2 are two closely related mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP-kinases), which are activated by phosphorylation of their activation loop by MAP-kinase and ERK-kinase (MEK 1 and 2). 
Upstream from MEK, ERK activation induced by cocaine involves the calcium-activated guanine nucleotide exchange factor Ras-GRF1 (
In the case of the BRAF program, a Novartis team was able to measure both phospho-MEK and phospho-ERK as biomarkers to indicate modulation of the BRAF
IGF-1 activates both its downstream signaling pathways, the MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways in the cochlea, which causes more efficient effects on HC protection than activation of a single signal cascade.
The main intracellular pathways activated by BDNF-TrkB signaling are the MEK-ERK, the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1, the PLCy-DAG-PKC/Ca
A similar effect was observed upon pharmacological inhibition of MEK1, the kinase activating the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) ERK1/2, indicating that ERK1/2 mediates Myd88-dependent macrophages spreading.
We employed macrophages with genetic deletion of Myd88 and p38, and pharmacological inhibition of the ERK1/2 kinase MEK1, to determine the control of LPS-induced macrophage spreading by these molecules.
Besides the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, inflammatory signal-related pathway also plays important role for pancreatic carcinogenesis.
For instance, ERK exhibits a strong negative feedback to Raf-1 in response to EGF which alters the efficiency of MEK inhibition (Sturm et al., 
KSR interacts with, B-Raf, C-Raf, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 coordinating the assembly of these components into a multiprotein complex (Therrien et al., 
Consider a set of 2 Raf, 5 MEK, and 10 ERK molecules (as shown in Figure 
When docking of ERK is impaired by a mutation, the KSR1-MEK-B-Raf complex persists even 20 min after stimulation, where otherwise, almost all B-Raf has left the complex at this time.
KSR1 can also route signals to the cytoplasm: in addition to binding Raf and MEK, KSR1 (but also other scaffolds such as Sef and IQGAP1) helps to assemble ERK1/2 dimers that are essential for interaction of ERK with cytoplasmic substrates (Casar et al., 
In theory, the three-tiered MAPK cascade comprising single phosphorylation of Raf and dual phosphorylation of MEK and ERK, is inherently ultrasensitive (Huang and Ferrell, 
Since the MEK/ERK signaling pathway is involved in many cellular processes, several different, cooperating mechanisms are necessary to determine the final outcome (Shaul and Seger, 
The initial literature based network was very limited and composed of bFGF/MEK/ERK/NANOG (Xu et al., 
The BRAF gene found on chromosome 7q encodes a serine/threonine kinase, which is regulated by binding to RAS and also functions in the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK-MAP kinase pathway (Koorstra et al., 
Dramatic tumor shrinkage was noted in a recent mutated KRAS lung cancer model when treated with a combination of a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor and a MEK (MAP/ERK kinase) inhibitor (Engelman et al., 
Villin protein expression was blocked in the presence of a specific inhibitor of MEK-1, an upstream mediator of the ERK1/2 MAPK signaling cascade, and in the presence of a casein kinase 1 (CK1) inhibitor, Wnt5a-enhanced villin expression was prevented.
The downstream Raf kinase activates MEK1/2 MAP kinase, which in turn activates extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) (Dhingra et al., 
Further examination of the regulation of histone acetylation in mammalian models has demonstrated that the observed training-related regulation of histone H3 acetylation is downstream of ERK/MAPK signaling, as the MEK inhibitor U0126 was found to impair the acetylation of H3 (Levenson et al., 
Both light-induced phase delays and advances are partially blocked by inhibitors of p44 MAPK/ERK1 and MAPK kinase (MAPKK/MEK) transcription (Obrietan et al., 

('MYC', 'MAX', 'increases')
MYCMAX_03 (EBOX) and AHRARNT_02 (AHRR) commonly occurred together and this was attributed to the similarity of their matrices.
MYC proteins function as active heterodimers with MAX via their conserved bHLH-LZ domains to exert transcriptional activation via direct binding to E-Box motifs (CANNTG) within target gene promoters and the subsequent recruitment of multiple transcriptional coactivators.
Heterodimerization with MAX is required for direct binding of MYC proteins to DNA. 
MYC is a member of a basic helix-loop-helix transcription-leucine zipper (bHLH-Zip) factor family whose members dimerize with MAX and bind to specific DNA sequences called E-boxes (
Early models of transcriptional suppression associated with MYC and MYCN involve an indirect mechanism in which MYC/MAX dimers compete with other bHLH-Zip transcription factors for E-box binding to alter target gene activity.
MYCN, as well as c-MYC, can heterodimerize with its partner MAX and activate the transcription of several target genes containing E-Box sites in their promoter regions.

We determined anti-endothelial cell antibody (AECA) bioactivity in protein A-elutes of baseline plasma in 305 participants in the VA NEPHRON-D study, a randomized trial of angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or dual ARB plus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy in type 2 diabetes with proteinuric nephropathy.
A VA NEPHRON-D primary endpoint [end-stage renal disease (ESRD), significant reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate, or death] was experienced by 58 individuals.
The study population for VA NEPHRON-D has been previously described.
