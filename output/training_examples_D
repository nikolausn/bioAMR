Raf/MEK/ERK1 pathway controls the increase of cdk2 activity after fertilization and its translocation into male and female nucleus.
KSRs act as scaffold proteins in the Ras/MAPK cascade and assemble Raf/MEK complexes, thereby facilitating MAPK activation (
Our findings indicate that modulating CB1 receptor function by selective agonists/inverse agonists can regulate the responsiveness of skeletal muscle toward insulin through its action on two key signaling pathways, namely PI 3-kinase/PKB and the Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 phosphorylation cascade.
Next we used Matrix ChIP to probe the recruitment of B-Raf, MEK, and ERK and their activated forms at the 
Those patients might be considered for Ras-Raf-MEK-MAPK-targeting therapies on the basis of molecular profiling data.
A finding that merits further study is the significant prognostic impact of KRAS mutation in endometroid carcinomas, potentially indicating that response to Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK-targeting therapies may differ by histological subtype.
This association should be validated in future studies comprising larger patient cohorts, as the value of KRAS mutation status as a predictor of response to therapies targeting the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK-pathway may differ by histological subtype.
Activated Raf stimulates MAPK/extraceiiular signal-related kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK), which activates ERK1 and ERK2, which in turn, phosphorylate the transcription factors Eikl and CREB.
Mutational activation of B-Raf causes developmental defects in zebrafish that are identical to those in the activating N-Ras mutants, and pharmacological inhibition of MEK using CI-1040 completely rescues these developmental defects.
To assess whether the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway is required during liver tumor progression and regression in the current model, western blot analysis was carried out using liver lysates from four groups: control (non-induced double-transgenic fish with normal liver), HL (induced for 2 weeks), HCC (induced for 4 weeks) and regressed (induced for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks of mifepristone withdrawal) (
Because Raf is known to activate MEK, we examined the effects of MEK knockdown in adult fly hearts.

('DAG', 'PKC', 'increases_activity')
High glucose is known to increase de novo synthesis of DAG, which is a potent activator of PKC in many cellular types (
As a consequence of the interaction between PKC and membrane-delimited DAG, cPKC and nPKC isoforms generally translocate from a cytosolic to a membrane-associated compartment.
The integral link between specific fatty acids, DAG, and PKC activation has been confirmed in studies addressing the effects of DAG kinase (DGK) isoforms, which lower intracellular DAG levels and reverse the activation of PKC, but these have also highlighted the complexity of DAG signaling (
cPKCs are activated in the presence of calcium, which binds to the C2 domain, and DAG, which binds to the C1 domains.
In contrast, DAG species derived from unsaturated fatty acids favor nPKC activation and inhibition at the level of the insulin receptor (IR), or IRS-1.
Increased levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAD-3P) cause activation of PKC isoforms through diacylglycerol (DAG) production and synthesis of advanced glycation end products (AGEs).
Diacylglycerol (DAG)-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms have been implicated in the phosphorylation of IRS1 at Ser
The molecular mechanism involves at least in part DAG-mediated PKC activation.
In particular, DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, which were shown to phosphorylate serine residues in insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1/2, thereby inhibiting insulin signal transduction and ultimately increasing hepatic glucose production (
By increasing hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL), fatty acids, glucose, and fructose increase the DAG pool which, through activation of PKCs, also impairs insulin signaling.
Several mechanisms, such as innate immune responses via Toll-like receptor-4, accumulation of diacylglycerols (DAG)/ceramides, and activation of protein kinase C (PKC), are considered to underlie skeletal muscle insulin resistance.
This results in increased flux of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to diacylglycerol (DAG), an activator of protein kinase C (PKC), and of triose phosphates to methylglyoxal, the main intracellular AGE precursor.
The putative mechanism is that intracellular hyperglycaemia cause increase in diacylglycerol (DAG) levels, activating PKC formation, leading to multiple pathogenetic consequences including altered expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthetase and angiogenic protein vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
It is well known that hyperglycaemia leads to elevated levels of DAG, which is a potent activator of PKC.

Our results suggest that a blunted insulin-mediated suppression of SM lipolysis may promote the accumulation of membrane saturated DAG, aggravating insulin resistance, at least partly mediated by PKC.

Our findings indicate that modulating CB1 receptor function by selective agonists/inverse agonists can regulate the responsiveness of skeletal muscle toward insulin through its action on two key signaling pathways, namely PI 3-kinase/PKB and the Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 phosphorylation cascade.
Consistent with the inhibition of ERK1/2, WIN55,212-2 or ACEA treatment for 24 h also suppresses insulin-induced CREB phosphorylation at Ser133, a downstream target of ERK1/2, as well as the activation of MEK1/2, the immediate upstream kinase of ERK (
Next we used Matrix ChIP to probe the recruitment of B-Raf, MEK, and ERK and their activated forms at the

Activation of ERK, a protein downstream of MEK1/2, has been implicated in the regulation of apoB100 secretion (
To determine whether MEK inhibitor studies were relevant to the defects associated with insulin-resistant macrophages, we next examined the role of MEK/ERK signaling in apoptotic responses of 
The ER stress response is associated with transient activation of both MEK/ERK and AKT signaling pathways, and both have antiapoptotic activity in this context (
In contrast, activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), but not the MEK-ERK pathway, in the VMH by leptin enhances the insulin-induced suppression of endogenous glucose production in an MCR-independent manner, with this effect of leptin occurring only in the presence of an increased plasma concentration of insulin.
Given that leptin requires 6 h to increase muscle glucose uptake, the transient activation of the MEK-ERK pathway in the VMH by leptin may play a role in the induction of synaptic plasticity in the VMH, resulting in the enhancement of MCR signaling in the nucleus and leading to an increase in insulin sensitivity in red-type muscle.
Leptin injection into the VMH increases whole-body insulin sensitivity via MEK-ERK and STAT3 signaling in the VMH. 
Leptin injection into the VMH increases glucose utilization in red-type muscle via MEK-ERK signaling in the VMH, whereas it enhances insulin-induced suppression of glycogen phosphorylase a activity in the liver via STAT3 in the VMH.
Systemic injection of leptin increases whole-body glucose utilization and glucose uptake in soleus muscle via MEK-ERK signaling in the VMH. 
Leptin-activated MEK-ERK signaling in the VMH increases insulin sensitivity and glucose utilization in red muscle through activation of MCR in the VMH.
In summary, we have found that the MEK-ERK pathway in the VMH plays an important role in leptin-induced glucose uptake in red-type muscle as well as whole-body glucose utilization.

The increased expression of cancer Osaka thyroid, a MAPK, leads to ERK activation through MEK, independent of BRAF signaling, promoting resistance to BRAF inhibitors.
These dimer complexes then lead to activation of MEK1 or MEK2, with subsequent signaling through activation of the ERK and MAPK pathways.
Given that most molecular mechanisms of resistance to selective BRAF inhibitors described from patient biopsy specimens appear to reactivate signaling through MAPK/ERK, an interest arose regarding the potential sequencing or combining of BRAF and MEK inhibitors.
