It is possible that activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR survival pathways by additional mutations in upstream oncogenes may replace the tumor's initial oncogene addition.
Although the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways have distinct effects on cell proliferation, they have many common downstream targets that may be able to function in promoting survival in the absence of the corresponding functional pathway.

BRAF dependent phosphotransferase activity was measured in a kinase reaction using inactive recombinant MEK1 as a BRAF substrate (BRAF kinase assay Kit, chemiluminescence detection, Millipore Upstate Temecula, CA, USA).
To test whether autoantibodies directed to BRAF interfere with its enzymatic activity, we analyzed the phosphorylation of MEK1 in presence of BRAF and autoantibodies to BRAF purified from 20 RA patients.
After quantification of purified autoantibodies to BRAF, we tested the phosphorylation of MEK1 in presence of BRAF and autoantibodies to BRAF purified from 20 RA patients.
Phosphorylation of MEK1 by BRAF was detected by Western blotting and quantified.
Among 20 purified autoantibodies to BRAF, 1 inhibited and 13 activated MEK1 phosphorylation (Figure

('Ca2+', 'PKC', 'increases_activity')
In vitro inhibit the activity of PKC of the protein kinase II Ca2+/calmodulina dependent and inhibit the activation, induced by 5HT, of the protein kinase activated by mithogen (MAPK).The proposed mechanism of pure ethyl EPA as the calcium-antagonist, blocking Ca2+ channels, is confirmed in cardiovascular studies.
Inhibition of intracellular Ca2+ release by TMB-8 also induced dephosphorylation of the P proteins, which is compatible with the requirement of intracellular Ca2+ for classical PKC isozyme activity.
Our results demonstrate that inhibition of Ca2+ dependent PKC activity decreases the phosphorylation of the P protein CK2 sites and protein synthesis.

PI3K activates PDK1, which phosphorylates Akt on Thr
Pretreatment of the cortical neurons with tricribine, which blocks all Akt isoforms (Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3) without inhibiting known upstream activators PDK1 and PI3K, completely eliminated the effects of atorvastatin on TNBL, terminal branch number, neurite number, and soma size.
To further ascertain the requirement for the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in the atorvastatin-induced increases in neurite outgrowth, we used phospho-specific antibodies to measure the relative levels of phosphorylated, active forms of the protein kinases phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) and Akt after cultured neurons were treated with atorvastatin.
The protein serine/threonine kinase 30-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase1 (PDK1) and Akt/PKB are both critical for the transforming effects of deregulated PI3K activity.
After insulin binding to IR and subsequent activation of IRS1, activated PI3K catalyzes the production of PI-3,4,5-P3, which results in the phosphorylation of PDK1 and several downstream enzymes, including Akt and PKC.
Conversely, Class I PI3Ks inhibit autophagy through a PDK1 and Akt/PKB pathway, which is inappropriate activated in many types of cancers.

E-cadherin may function as a tumor proliferation enhancer via activating the MEK/ERK pathway in development of ovarian epithelial cancers.
Meanwhile, our results convincingly indicate that in SKOV-3 cells the activation of MEK/ERK triggered by cell-cell adhesion is E-cadherin-dependent, evidenced by the fact that both siRNA targeting E-cadherin and its specific neutralizing antibody are able to markedly prevent the phosphorylation of MEK or ERK.

To elucidate the roles of receptor tyrosine kinases RET and VEGFR2 and the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling cascade in cancer treatment with sorafenib.
The MEK/ERK pathway is also called the RAF/MEK/ERK serine/threonine kinase cascade, as its upstream molecules belong to the RAF kinase family of serine/threonine kinases
Specifically, one serine/threonine kinase, cRAF, and two tyrosine kinases, VEGFR2 and RET, and their potential downstream MEK/ERK pathway targets were examined.
To investigate the effect of sorafenib on the post-transcriptional events in cells, the expression and phosphorylation level of the following four proteins were detected by Western blot assays: VEGFR2, RET, MEK, and ERK.
At the transcriptional level, we found that sorafenib could briefly activate RET expression and inhibit VEGFR2 expression independent of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway in A549 cells; at the post-transcriptional level, sorafenib directly inhibited the phosphorylation of RET and VEGFR2 and blocked the downstream factors of the MEK/ERK pathway.
The two kinases RET and VEGFR2 could be the targets of sorafenib treatment, but they may not be the upstream messengers of the MEK/ERK kinases pathway.
The downstream signaling molecules of the MEK/ERK kinase pathway are also potential candidates for the sorafenib treatment of lung cancer.
According to the results for HeLa cells, we found that sorafenib could inhibit VEGFR2 expression but had no effect on the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway at the transcriptional level.
At the post-transcriptional level, sorafenib directly inhibited RET and VEGFR2 phosphorylation and blocked the downstream factors of the MEK/ERK pathway.
RET, VEGFR2 and the downstream signaling molecules of the MEK/ERK kinase pathway are also important potential targets for sorafenib in the treatment of cervical cancer.
In contrast to the results in the above cell lines, sorafenib inhibited RET expression and activated VEGFR2 expression in the HepG2 cells, with little effect on the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway at the transcriptional level.
Moreover, sorafenib targeted the downstream molecules of RET and VEGFR2 and blocked the MEK/ERK pathway by inhibiting ERK phosphorylation at the post-transcriptional level.
In addition, based on the present results, the MEK/ERK kinase signaling cascade is clearly an important effective target pathway for cancer treatment.
The receptor tyrosine kinases RET and VEGFR2 and the MEK/ERK kinase signaling cascade are important targets for cancer treatment with sorafenib, even though these factors participate in different pharmacological mechanisms in different cell lines.
Therefore, the present study was consistent with previous results and provided more evidence for kinases as the targets in cancer therapy and partially revealed the pharmacological mechanism, including molecules downstream of the MEK/ERK kinase pathway and the pathways initiated by RET or VEGFR2, of sorafenib in cancer treatment.
In future studies, we will perform kinase spectrum screening to identify additional protein kinases involved in the mechanisms of cancer treatment, such as the downstream molecules of the MEK/ERK kinase pathway and the pathways in which RET and VEGFR2 are involved.
Sorafenib affected the phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinase RET and VEGFR2, as well as MEK/ERK kinases signaling cascades in three cell lines.
(A) Sorafenib inhibited RET and VEGFR2 phosphorylation dose-dependently while activated MEK and ERK phosphorylation in A549 cells.
(B) Sorafenib also inhibited RET and VEGFR2 phosphorylation, and slightly activated MEK and ERK phosphorylation in HeLa cells.
(C) Sorafenib activated the phosphorylation of RET, VEGFR2, and MEK, but inhibited ERK phosphorylation in HepG2 cells.

Dysregulated signaling through the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways is often the result of genetic alterations in critical components in these pathways or upstream activators.
The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways have been shown over the past 25 years to play key roles in the transmission of proliferative signals from membrane bound receptors.
The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways consist of kinases cascades that are regulated by phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation by specific kinases, phosphatases as well as GTP/GDP exchange proteins, adaptor proteins and scaffolding proteins.
An introductory overview of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is presented in Figure 
The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is regulated by Ras (indicated in green ovals), as well as various upstream growth factor receptors (indicated in purple) and non-receptor kinases.
The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway also interacts with key proteins involved in protein translation (indicated in green ovals).
Thus suppression of MEK and ERK activities will have profound effects on cell growth and aging.
Activated ERK can also phosphorylate B-Raf, Raf-1 and MEK1 which alter their activity (Figure 
The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways can affect protein translation by complex interactions regulating the mTORC1 (grouped together in a purple box) and mTORC2 (grouped together in a blue box) complexes.
GF stimulation results in GFR activation which can activate both the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways.
The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways can be activated by mutations/amplifications of upstream growth factor receptors.
The abnormal production of growth factors can result in receptor activation which in turns mobilizes the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR cascades.

The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway can regulate p53 activity and p53 can also induce the activity of key components of this pathway [
In certain scenarios, increased p53 expression after chemotherapeutic drug treatment may lead to increased Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways activation, resulting in an undesired pro-proliferative effect [

Recent reports have also demonstrated that the suppression of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways may prevent the induction of cellular senescence and aging.
In conclusion, the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways are prime therapeutic targets for diverse human diseases as well as aging.
It is possible that activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR survival pathways by additional mutations in upstream oncogenes may replace the tumor's initial oncogene addition.
Although the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways have distinct effects on cell proliferation, they have many common downstream targets that may be able to function in promoting survival in the absence of the corresponding functional pathway.

STS mediated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is dependent on PHB protein expression and PHB is also required for MEK1 activity, suggesting that a possible novel regulatory loop affecting this pathway is mediated by PHB.
Published studies have indicated that PHB plays an important role in the Ras-mediated activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway [
When isolating liver cells, some pathways are activated, e.g., the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway, whereas others are silenced (e.g.
