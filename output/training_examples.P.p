aS'The inputs of the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade are the activated forms of Ras and Rap1, Ras-GTP and Rap1-GTP.'
p978
aS'Since the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade is considered a core component of the signaling network, and Raf isoforms are key downstream targets of ErbB receptors '
p979
aS'The MEK/ERK pathway is critical to Epo stimulation-dependent erythroid cell proliferation and survival, which is mediated by the Grb2-Ras-Raf1 pathway '
p980
aS'Inhibition of MEK/ERK was achieved using U0126 (or inactive analogue U0124; both 5 uM), tpl2 (tpl2 kinase Inhibitor II; 1 uM), Raf (Raf Kinase Inhibitor IV; 500 nM), RSK (BI-D1870; 500 nM; Selleckchem, Houston, TX) and MSK (H-89; 10 uM; Sigma Aldrich, Poole, UK) inhibitors (all from Calbiochem, San Diego, CA unless otherwise stated).'
p981
aS'It was previously shown that the Raf/MEK/ERK MAPK pathway is necessary and sufficient for the Dar response: hyper activation of the pathway by the over expression of constitutively active forms of LIN-45 (Raf), MEK-2 (MEK), or MPK-1 (ERK) results in tail swelling in the absence of infection (as we have shown for constitutively active EGL-30* and RHO-1*), while mutations in '
p982
aS'Previously it has been shown that a conserved LIN-45 (Raf)/MEK-2 (MEK)/MPK-1 (ERK) MAPK pathway is required for the Dar response '

aS'We, therefore, investigated the role of the MAPK (Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK) and PI3K pathways in upregulation of EphA2 during '
p984
aS'Since we demonstrated that phosphorylation and acetylation of p65 was not responsible for the observed Salp15-induced modulation of cytokine responses, we set out to identify the mechanisms responsible for the Salp15-induced Raf-1/MEK-dependent decrease in TLR-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines.'

aS'This was completely restored using Raf (GW5074) or MEK (U0126) inhibitors.'

p988
aS'Further analysis revealed that the Raf/MEK/ERK/Ets-1 pathway mediates Ras-induced reactivation.'
p989
aS'Further analysis revealed that the activation of the cellular Raf/MEK/ERK/Ets-1 pathway is shared by multiple upstream inducers to trigger reactivation.'
p990
aS'To explore the mechanism by which the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway reactivates KSHV, reporter assays were conducted on the RTA promoter in 293T cells.'
p991
aS'We further investigated whether the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway also contributes to KSHV spontaneous reactivation.'

p994
aS'The effectiveness of this genome-wide analysis was validated by revealing the critical role of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK/Ets-1 pathway in mediating signals from the cell surface to the viral genome in the nucleus to reactivate KSHV.'
p995
aS'Among these, the MAP kinase signalling cascade (Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK) plays a pivotal role and is essential for a variety of processes such as growth, differentiation, proliferation, survival and apoptosis in all eukaryotes.'
p996
aS'In our previous report, we demonstrated that PIO treatment in PCK rats inhibited renal Raf/MEK/ERK and AKT/mTOR/S6 activity and reduced proliferation of diseased renal cells ['

aS'For instance: (1) STAT3 is not activated by TGFA; (2) Phosphorylation of the autocatalytic domain of P70S6 (termed P70S6K in the model) is independent of ERK1; (3) The activation of CREB1 in response to TGFA is likely to be caused by a MEK1 independent route; (4) Phosphorylation of AKT1 is regulated to PI3K activity; and (5) The activation of MEK1 and ERK1 is dependent to MAP3K activation.'
p3579
aS'We have previously reported that NRG1-stimulated migration of B lymphoblasts is PI3K-AKT1dependent and impaired in patients with schizophrenia and significantly linked to the catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) Val108/158Met functional polymorphism.'
p3580
aS'Since SH-SY5Y cells also migrate in response to NRG1 in a PI3K/AKT1-dependent manner, the SH-SY5Y-COMT transfection system is suited for this experiment.'
p3581
aS'As with other chemokine-stimulated migratory responses, activation of AKT1is essential for NRG1-stimulated cell adhesion and migration in B lymphoblasts, evidenced by the severe attenuation of adhesion and migration by PI3K or AKT1 inhibition in these cells '

aS'In conclusion, these data show that GDC-0941 has broad anti-proliferative activity amongst many tumor types represented in the NCI-60 cell panel, suggesting its clinical utility against multiple tumor types, and that a number of tumor cell lines with activated AKT1 are highly sensitive to inhibition of PI3K with GDC-0941.'
p3583
aS'Taken together, these results suggest that the miR-99 family plays an important role in dermal wound healing by concurrently targeting IGF1R, mTOR, and AKT1 (as well as AKT2, to a lesser extent), which in turn modulate the PI3K/AKT and mTOR signaling pathways.'
p3584
aS'We further demonstrated that inhibition of AKT1, mTORC1, mTORC2 and PI3K reduced CA916798 expression, while overexpression of AKT1 augmented CA916798 expression.'
p3585
aS'Additionally we focus on HER2 due to the HER2+ status of the cell lines, PIK3CA due to the known mutation in HCC1954, as well as MAPK1 and AKT1 as main players in the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathway, respectively. '

aS'As a read-out of PI3K/AKT signalling in NSCLC we determined the phosphorylation status of residue S473 of AKT1 (pAKT).'
p3588
aS'In addition, this manuscript provides novel experimental evidence to the observation that SCCs and ADCs develop by different genetic alterations: i) mutations in PIK3CA and AKT1 (3% altogether) were detected only in SCCs [this manuscript; 24] whereas KRAS mutations were observed in ADCs (19%); ii) SCC patients (85%) presented at least one genetic alteration in PI3KCA, AKT1, AKT2 or PTEN more frequently than ADC patients (50%); iii) PIK3CA copy gains occurred more frequently in SCCs (25%) than in ADCs (9%) as described previously '
p3589

p4679
aS'Although there was no difference in the protein expression of AR in siFOXA1-transfected cells or in nega-transfected cells, siFOXA1-transfected cells showed almost 80% reduction of PSA promoter activity compare to that of nega-transfected cells ('

aS'(C, D) LNCaP cells were transfected with a negative control siRNA (nega) or with an AR siRNA (si AR) and/or a FOXA1 siRNA (si FOXA1#1) and, 48 h after transfection, AR mRNA and protein (C) or IGFBP-3 mRNA levels (D) were analyzed using qRT-PCR and/or western blot analysis.'
p4682
aS'In the prostate, FOXA1 interacts with the AR and controls androgen induced activation of prostate-specific genes '

aS'Another possible mechanism of FOXA1 regulation of IGFBP-3 could be through FOXA1 regulation of the AR.'

aS'One of the potentially therapeutically useful features of FOXA1 is that it does not require the ligand binding domain of the AR for its effects on the AR.'
p4685
aS'FOXA1 directly binds to the DNA binding domain of AR and alters the 3-D structure of the AR '

aS'Survival curves were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method and differences in survival rates between FOXA1-positive and FOXA1-negative cases, and between AR-positive and AR-negative cases, were compared using a log-rank test.'

aS'Furthermore, the association between FOXA1 and ER in breast cancer and FOXA1 and androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer suggests that expression levels of FOXA1 may influence responsiveness to antihormonal treatment in hormone dependent cancers.'
p4688
aS'FOXA1 has been recognized as an important transcription factor that modulates the functions of steroid receptors such as estrogen receptor in breast cancer and AR in prostate cancer.'
p4689
aS'Pioneer factors such as FOXA1 are able to bind to tightly packed heterochromatin, opening DNA structure to allow binding and regulation by nuclear receptors, including ER, GR and AR '
p4690
aS'In contrast, FOXA1 appears to play a dual role in androgen signalling, where it promotes androgen responsiveness of some AR targets and acts as a repressor of others.'
p4691
aS'This is supported by a recent study in LNCaP prostate cancer cells where depletion of FOXA1 caused significant remodelling of AR binding patterns and a marked increase in androgen regulated transcripts '
p4692
aS'A search in the JASPAR CORE database provided further evidence that the rs11257655 SNP is located within predicted binding sites for FOXA1 and FOXA2, with only the T risk-allele predicted to contain a FOXA1 and FOXA2 consensus core-binding motif ('
