HBx transactivates viral and host genes and stimulates the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signal transduction pathway.

('DAG', 'PKC', 'increases_activity')
Contraction of normal esophageal circular muscle (ESO) in response to acetylcholine (ACh) is linked to M2 muscarinic receptors activating at least three intracellular phospholipases, i.e., phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC), phospholipase D (PLD), and the high molecular weight (85 kDa) cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) to induce phosphatidylcholine (PC) metabolism, production of diacylglycerol (DAG) and arachidonic acid (AA), resulting in activation of a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent pathway.
Resting LES tone is associated with submaximal PI hydrolysis resulting in submaximal levels of inositol trisphosphate (IP3-induced Ca++ release, and interaction with DAG to activate PKC.

('MEK', 'ERK', 'adds_modification')
A number of agents designed to inhibit the kinase components of those
signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)-extracellular
signal-regulated kinase kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, have
been developed and clinically tested in cancer treatment, such as lung, breast cancer and
melanoma.
treated ovarian cancer cell lines with CDDP and any of a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002),
a MEK inhibitor (PD98059), or a MEK/ERK activator [phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)],
and assessed cell viability, expression of MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt, cell cycle distribution and
apoptosis.
